Data Structures are the foundation of how data is organized in memory and accessed efficiently. They form the foundation of writing programs that scale beyond small inputs, where performance, memory usage, and predictability matter. Data Structures are fundamentally about trade-offs, time versus space, simplicity versus efficiency and choosing the right approach based on how data is accessed and modified. Rather than memorizing solutions, understanding data structures builds the ability to reason about efficiency, understand how code behaves as input grows, and design systems that remain reliable under load.

Here in the notes, we'll include notes on various data structures. We will discuss how each data structure works, their trade-offs, their performance characteristics, and when to use them.
