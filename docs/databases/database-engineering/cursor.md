# Cursors

A **cursor** in database management systems (DBMS) is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and traverse rows of a result set returned by a query. It acts as a pointer that allows the application to iterate over a set of records one at a time. Cursors are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when you need to perform row-by-row operations (like updates or complex calculations) that cannot be achieved in a single SQL query.

## Types of Cursors

Cursors are primarily classified based on their **scope** (how they handle result sets) and their **behavior** (how they interact with the data).

### Implicit Cursors

- These are automatically created by the DBMS when an SQL statement is executed that returns a result.
- The database system internally manages these cursors, so users do not explicitly declare or open them.
- Example: In SQL, a `SELECT` query without explicitly defining a cursor results in an implicit cursor being used by the DBMS.

### Explicit Cursors

- These cursors are defined and controlled explicitly by the user.
- Users declare, open, fetch, and close them, offering full control over the query execution process.
- Explicit cursors are typically used when the result set is large or when complex, row-by-row operations are needed.
- **Examples**: `DECLARE CURSOR` in SQL (used in databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle).

## Types of Cursors Based on Behavior

### Static Cursor

- A static cursor makes a snapshot of the result set when it is opened and does not reflect changes made to the data after the cursor is opened.
- **Use case**: Ideal for reporting scenarios where the data doesn't change during the operation.

### Dynamic Cursor

- A dynamic cursor reflects changes to the underlying data during cursor operations, such as insertions, deletions, or updates.
- **Use case**: Useful in real-time applications where data may change while the cursor is in use.

### Forward-Only Cursor

- This type of cursor only allows moving forward through the result set, and once a row is fetched, it cannot be retrieved again.
- **Use case**: Often used when data is being processed sequentially.

### Scroll Cursor

- A scroll cursor allows movement both forward and backward through the result set.
- **Use case**: Useful when you need random access to rows and may need to navigate in both directions.

### Read-Only Cursor

- A read-only cursor allows only retrieval of data and not any modifications.
- **Use case**: Used when you only need to display data, not alter it.

### Updatable Cursor

- An updatable cursor allows for both retrieving and modifying data.
- **Use case**: Used when you need to process rows and possibly update the underlying database.

## Cursors Based on Location (Server vs Client)

### Server Cursor

- The cursor is managed and stored on the database server.
- The server handles the cursor’s life cycle, including opening, fetching, and closing.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces network traffic as the database server processes the data and only sends required rows to the client.
  - More efficient for large datasets because the client only fetches the data as needed.
- **Disadvantages**:

  - Can put a load on the database server, especially for long-running queries.

- **Examples**: In databases like Oracle or SQL Server, the server handles the cursor in the back-end, and clients fetch rows from it.

### Client Cursor

- The cursor is managed on the client-side, with the client application handling the cursor’s lifecycle.
- This involves fetching the entire result set from the server into memory, after which the application iterates over the rows locally.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces load on the database server as it does not have to manage the cursor.
  - Better control over the result set on the client-side.
- **Disadvantages**:

  - High memory consumption as the entire result set must be transferred and stored locally.
  - Slower performance with large datasets due to the transfer of all rows to the client.

- **Examples**: When using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) or JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) in a client-server environment.

## Cursor Life Cycle

The life cycle of a cursor involves several stages:

### Declare

- A cursor is declared with a SQL query that defines the result set. This step does not execute the query but simply prepares it for use.
- Example (in SQL):
  ```sql
  DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR SELECT column1, column2 FROM table;
  ```

### Open

- The cursor is opened, executing the associated query and allocating resources. This step positions the cursor before the first row of the result set.
- Example:
  ```sql
  OPEN cursor_name;
  ```

### Fetch

- The `FETCH` operation retrieves one or more rows from the result set. After each fetch, the cursor moves to the next row.
- Example:
  ```sql
  FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_name INTO @variable1, @variable2;
  ```

### Close

- After all required operations are completed, the cursor is closed, releasing any associated resources.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CLOSE cursor_name;
  ```

### Deallocate

- Optionally, after the cursor is closed, the cursor is deallocated to remove it from memory.
- Example:
  ```sql
  DEALLOCATE cursor_name;
  ```

## Use Cases for Cursors

### Row-by-Row Processing

- When you need to process each row of a result set individually, such as calculating values or performing complex transformations.

### Data Migration

- Moving data from one database or table to another, where row-by-row processing is required, such as when transforming data during the migration.

### Batch Processing

- Performing batch updates or complex operations where each row needs to be processed sequentially.

### Reporting

- Generating reports that require complex calculations or aggregations on each row in the result set.

### Complex Data Manipulations

- For operations like auditing, where you need to check or modify data based on certain conditions on a row-by-row basis.

## Pros and Cons of Using Cursors

### Pros

1. **Fine-Grained Control**:

   - Cursors provide full control over the retrieval and manipulation of each row, useful for complex operations that cannot be performed in a single SQL query.

2. **Flexibility**:

   - They allow for operations like updates or inserts to be performed one row at a time, making it easier to manage large datasets or perform custom logic on each row.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Cursors allow for more detailed error handling, as the application can control the process and manage issues one row at a time.

### Cons

1. **Performance Overhead**:
   - Cursors can be slower than set-based operations. Fetching data row by row is inefficient for large datasets compared to operations that return results in bulk.
2. **Resource Intensive**:

   - Cursors consume significant memory, especially on the server-side (in the case of server cursors). Each open cursor uses resources, and if not properly closed, they can lead to resource leaks.

3. **Complexity**:

   - Using cursors introduces additional complexity in managing their lifecycle (open, fetch, close, deallocate), which can lead to code maintenance challenges.

4. **Potential for Deadlocks**:
   - Long-running cursors, especially those with large result sets, can hold locks on database resources for extended periods, increasing the risk of deadlocks.
