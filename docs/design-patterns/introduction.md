# Introduction

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common software design problems. They are templates or blueprints that can be adapted to address particular design challenges in object-oriented software development. These patterns abstract complex design concepts, providing developers with a common vocabulary for discussing software structures. The goal of design patterns is to help developers write code that is more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

Design patterns are not ready-to-use code but guidelines to solve recurring design problems in a more efficient way. They emerged from the book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_ by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (the "Gang of Four" or GoF), and they have since become a cornerstone of software engineering.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

1. **Standardized Solutions:** Design patterns provide well-established and standardized solutions to common problems. By using design patterns, developers avoid reinventing the wheel and can rely on solutions that have been tested and optimized in real-world applications.

2. **Maintainability:** By structuring code in a standard way, design patterns make it easier to modify and extend the software without introducing bugs. This leads to improved maintainability in the long term.

3. **Flexibility and Scalability:** Design patterns often encourage decoupling of components, making it easier to modify or extend parts of a system without impacting other parts. This enables easier scaling of software.

4. **Improved Communication:** Patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers. Using well-known design patterns allows developers to communicate their designs more effectively, avoiding misunderstandings and confusion.

5. **Efficiency:** Reusing design patterns reduces the amount of time spent designing new solutions. Developers can focus on higher-level design problems rather than solving recurring issues.

6. **Best Practices:** Patterns embody best practices that have been learned over years of software engineering. They reflect knowledge accumulated from previous mistakes and successes in real-world projects.

## Overview of the 3 Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are generally divided into three main categories based on the type of problem they solve: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns. Each category addresses a specific aspect of software design.

### Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and allowing the system to be independent of how objects are created, composed, and represented.

Key Creational Design Patterns:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Allows the construction of complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, rather than creating new instances.

Creational patterns help promote flexibility and reusability by isolating the code that creates objects from the code that uses them.

### Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. They help simplify the relationships between objects, providing methods for creating new structures without changing the existing code base.

Key Structural Design Patterns:

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a wrapper around one of the interfaces.
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional functionality to an object dynamically, without altering its structure.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making the system easier to use.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the number of objects created by sharing common data among similar objects.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Structural patterns enhance code modularity and flexibility by defining simple ways to compose objects into larger structures.

### Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on the communication between objects and the delegation of responsibilities. These patterns describe algorithms, the flow of control, and how objects interact with each other. They help achieve loose coupling in interactions and define how objects should communicate and share responsibility.

Key Behavioral Design Patterns:

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows multiple handlers to process a request, with each handler deciding whether to process the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Interpreter**: Defines a representation for a grammar and provides an interpreter to evaluate sentences in the language.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that coordinates the interactions between objects, centralizing the communication and reducing dependencies.
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor**: Allows new operations to be added to an object structure without modifying the objects themselves.

Behavioral patterns focus on simplifying object collaboration and streamlining complex communication between objects.
