# Introduction

This repository contains my personal collection of notes, primarily focused on Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Backend Development. As I explore various topics in these areas, I document my learnings and publish them on this website.

If you come across any issues or errors in the notes, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository.
