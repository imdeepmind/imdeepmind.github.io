# Introduction

This repository contains my personal collection of notes, primarily focused on Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Backend Development. As I explore various topics in these areas, I document my learnings and publish them on this website.

If you come across any issues or errors in the notes, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository.

## Sources

The notes are primarily created by me or with the assistance of ChatGPT. Occasionally, they include content adapted from other sources, though I typically rework the material rather than copying it verbatim.
