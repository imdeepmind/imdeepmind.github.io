# Introduction

These are my notes on machine learning (ML), covering both foundational concepts and interoperability protocols. Currently, Iâ€™ve documented the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its practical applications, including architecture, example agents, and integration with frameworks like LangChain. As I continue to explore ML, I plan to expand these notes with more algorithms, models, and real-world case studies. My aim is to build a strong understanding of ML principles and how they connect with modern AI systems and tools.
