# Introduction

An **Operating System (OS)** is a **software layer** that sits **between the hardware and user applications**, providing an abstraction of hardware resources and managing them efficiently. It acts as an **intermediary** between the user and the computer hardware.

## Key Functions of an Operating System

### Abstraction of Hardware

- Provides high-level APIs and abstractions (e.g., files instead of disk sectors, processes instead of raw CPU instructions).
- Shields application developers from complex hardware details.

### Resource Management

- Manages **CPU, memory, I/O devices, storage**, and other resources among multiple applications.
- Ensures **fairness, efficiency, and security** in resource usage.

### Process and Thread Management

- Handles **creation, scheduling, and termination** of processes and threads.
- Provides isolation and coordination between concurrently running programs.

### Memory Management

- Manages **allocation and deallocation of memory** to processes.
- Implements techniques like **virtual memory, paging, and segmentation**.

### File System Management

- Organizes data in **files and directories**, and controls how data is stored and retrieved.
- Provides permissions and metadata for files.

### Device Management

- Manages **I/O devices** (keyboard, mouse, disks, printers) through device drivers.
- Provides **uniform interfaces** for applications to interact with devices.

### Security and Access Control

- Prevents **unauthorized access** to hardware and software resources.
- Implements **authentication, encryption, isolation, and permissions**.

### User Interface

- Offers **CLI (Command Line Interface)** or **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** for user interaction.

## Why Do We Need Operating Systems?

We need Operating Systems for a variety of reasons. While theoretically possible, **building applications directly on hardware is impractical and inefficient** for several reasons:

### Lack of Abstraction

- Hardware interfaces (CPU registers, memory addresses, I/O ports) are **low-level and complex**.
- Every application would need to **reinvent the wheel**: write drivers, manage memory, handle CPU scheduling, etc.

**With OS:** You get high-level APIs and services that abstract hardware complexities.

### Poor Portability

- Apps built for one hardware platform (e.g., x86) would not work on another (e.g., ARM) without extensive changes.

**With OS:** Applications can be written once and run across different hardware platforms (thanks to the OS abstraction layer).

### No Resource Management

- Direct hardware access means there's **no coordination** in managing CPU, memory, I/O, etc.
- Multiple apps would **conflict**, possibly corrupting data or crashing the system.

**With OS:** The kernel allocates and schedules resources to ensure **safe and fair** usage.

### No Multitasking or Concurrency

- Directly accessing hardware cannot support **concurrent execution of multiple apps or tasks**.

**With OS:** Supports **multitasking** via process/thread scheduling, enabling responsive systems.

### No Memory Protection

- Applications could **overwrite each otherâ€™s memory**, leading to bugs and crashes.

**With OS:** Implements **virtual memory** and **protection mechanisms** to isolate processes.

### No Security

- Without an OS, there are **no access control mechanisms**.
- Any program can read/write any memory or device, causing massive vulnerabilities.

**With OS:** You get **user authentication, permissions, isolation**, etc.

### Increased Development Time

- Writing device drivers, file systems, and resource managers **for every application** is time-consuming and error-prone.

**With OS:** You write applications using **existing services and libraries**, accelerating development.
