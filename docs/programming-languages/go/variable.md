# Variables and Scope

## Variables in Go

A variable in Go is a storage location with a name, associated with a type, that holds a value. Variables can be declared using the `var` keyword or short declaration syntax.

### Variable Declaration

Go supports three ways to declare variables:

1. **Using `var` keyword (explicit type):**

   ```go
   var name string
   name = "John"
   ```

2. **Using `var` keyword (implicit type inference):**

   ```go
   var age = 30
   ```

3. **Short variable declaration (only inside functions):**
   ```go
   name := "Alice"
   ```

### Multiple Variable Declarations

You can declare and initialize multiple variables at once:

```go
var x, y int = 10, 20
a, b := 3.14, "Hello"
```

### Default Values

If a variable is declared but not initialized, it gets a default value based on its type:

- Numeric types: `0`
- Strings: `""`
- Booleans: `false`
- Pointers, slices, maps, channels, interfaces: `nil`

### Constants in Go

In addition to variables, Go also supports **constants**, which are similar to variables but, once assigned, cannot be changed. Constants can be typed or untyped.

#### Declaring Constants

1. **Using `const` keyword:**

   Constants are declared using the `const` keyword. A constant's value must be known at compile time, and it can be of any basic or derived type.

   ```go
   const pi = 3.14      // Untyped constant
   const radius = 10    // Untyped constant
   const isActive = true // Untyped constant
   ```

2. **Typed Constants:**

   You can also declare typed constants by specifying the type explicitly.

   ```go
   const daysInWeek int = 7
   ```

#### Advantages of Constants

- **Immutability:** Constants are read-only. Once assigned, their values cannot be changed.
- **Performance:** Because constants are evaluated at compile time, using constants can improve performance (no need to re-evaluate the value during runtime).
- **Expressiveness:** Constants make code more expressive and easier to understand, especially for values that are logically constant, like mathematical constants or configuration settings.

#### Example of Constants in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const Pi = 3.14159
const Greeting = "Hello, Go!"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Pi:", Pi)
    fmt.Println(Greeting)
}
```

In the example above, `Pi` and `Greeting` are constants that cannot be changed during the programâ€™s execution.

#### Constant Expressions

Go allows you to use constants in expressions. For example:

```go
const (
    x = 5
    y = 10
    sum = x + y // sum is a constant, evaluated at compile time
)
```

### Data Types in Go

Go is a statically typed language, meaning the type of a variable is determined at compile time.

#### Basic Data Types

1. **Numeric Types:**

   - Integer: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64` (and their unsigned counterparts `uint`, etc.)
   - Floating-point: `float32`, `float64`
   - Complex numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`

2. **String:**

   - UTF-8 encoded sequence of characters.
   - Immutable.

3. **Boolean:**
   - Represented as `true` or `false`.

### Composite Data Types

#### Array

Fixed-size, homogeneous collection of elements.

```go
var arr [5]int
arr[0] = 10
```

#### Slice

Dynamic-sized, more powerful abstraction over arrays.

```go
nums := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

#### Map

Key-value pairs.

```go
scores := map[string]int{"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85}
```

#### Struct

Custom data structure grouping multiple fields.

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

#### Pointer

Holds the memory address of a variable.

```go
var p *int
```

### Special Types

#### Interface

Defines a set of methods that a type must implement.

```go
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}
```

#### Function Type

Functions are first-class citizens and can be assigned to variables.

```go
var add func(int, int) int
```

## Variable Scope in Go

The scope of a variable defines where it can be accessed in a program.

### Local Scope

Variables declared inside a function or block are accessible only within that block.

```go
func main() {
    x := 10 // Local to main
    fmt.Println(x)
}
```

### Package Scope

Variables declared outside functions (at the package level) are accessible across the same package.

```go
var count int // Accessible by all functions in the package
```

### Global Scope

Go doesn't have true "global variables" because all variables are bound to a package. However, public variables (starting with an uppercase letter) can be accessed by other packages if exported.

```go
var PublicVar int // Accessible from other packages
```

### Shadowing

A local variable can shadow a package-level or global variable with the same name.

```go
var x = 5

func main() {
    x := 10 // Shadows the package-level variable
    fmt.Println(x) // Prints 10
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always initialize variables when possible to avoid confusion with default values.
2. Use short declarations (`:=`) for concise code, but only within functions.
3. Use descriptive variable names to make the code readable.
4. Keep variable scope as narrow as possible to reduce side effects.
5. Use constants for values that do not change during program execution to improve performance and readability.

**Example Code**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Package-level variable
var packageVar = "I'm accessible within this package!"
const pi = 3.14159 // Constant

func main() {
    // Local variables
    var localVar int = 42
    shortVar := "I was declared using short syntax!"

    fmt.Println(packageVar)
    fmt.Println(localVar)
    fmt.Println(shortVar)
    fmt.Println("Pi constant:", pi)

    demonstrateScope()
}

func demonstrateScope() {
    // Access package-level variable
    fmt.Println(packageVar)

    // localVar is not accessible here, so the following line would cause an error:
    // fmt.Println(localVar)
}
```
