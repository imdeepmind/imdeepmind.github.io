# Introduction

Currently, I have notes on Python, JavaScript, and Go. I plan to learn C, C++, Rust, and Assembly next. Although I have previously learned C, C++, and Assembly, I don't remember these languages very well. As a developer, I believe it's important to have a solid understanding of C, C++, and Assembly, as they form the foundation for many modern languages and systems.
