# Introduction

These are my notes on programming, covering both programming languages and core concepts. Currently, I’ve documented Python, JavaScript, and Go. I plan to explore C, C++, Rust, and Assembly next. While I’ve studied C, C++, and Assembly in the past, my familiarity with them has faded over time. As a developer, I believe it's essential to have a strong grasp of C, C++, and Assembly, since they form the foundation of many modern programming languages and system-level concepts.
