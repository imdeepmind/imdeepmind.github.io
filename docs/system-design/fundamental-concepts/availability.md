# Availability

Availability refers to the degree to which a system is operational and accessible when needed. It is typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.9% uptime).

## Factors Influencing Availability:

1. **Redundancy:**

   - Having backup components or systems (e.g., multiple servers, replicated databases) to ensure continuity in case of failure.

2. **Failover Mechanisms:**

   - Automatically switching to a standby system or resource when the primary one fails.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Proactive identification of issues through health checks and notifications.

## Measuring Availability:

- **Formula:** `Availability = (Uptime / Total Time) * 100`

- Example Availability Levels:
  - 99.9% ("Three Nines") – ~8.77 hours of downtime per year.
  - 99.99% ("Four Nines") – ~52.6 minutes of downtime per year.
