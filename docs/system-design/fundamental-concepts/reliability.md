# Reliability

Reliability refers to a systemâ€™s ability to perform its intended function consistently and correctly over time, even under adverse conditions.

## Characteristics of Reliability:

1. **Consistency:**

   - The system produces the same results for the same input.

2. **Fault Tolerance:**

   - The ability to handle and recover from failures gracefully.

3. **Durability:**
   - Ensuring data is not lost or corrupted even in the event of system crashes.

## Enhancing Reliability:

- **Redundant Systems:** Having backups for critical components.
- **Regular Testing:** Implementing failure injection testing, such as chaos engineering.
- **Data Backups:** Regularly creating and testing backups to prevent data loss.

## Metrics for Reliability:

- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** Average time between system failures.
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):** Average time required to restore the system after a failure.
