Below is a breakdown of each property with practical examples.","s":"ACID","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"","p":164},{"i":167,"t":"Atomicity means that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, where either all operations within the transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are. If an error occurs or something goes wrong, the transaction must be rolled back to ensure the database does not remain in an inconsistent state. If any operation in the transaction fails (e.g., a UPDATE fails), the entire transaction will be rolled back, and no changes will be applied to the database. A rollback ensures the database is restored to its state before the transaction started. Example: Consider a transaction that involves transferring money from one account to another. If any step fails, both operations (debit and credit) should be rolled back. BEGIN; -- Debit from account 1 UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- If an error occurs, roll back the transaction -- Let's assume the credit operation fails, and We roll back UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- If something goes wrong, rollback the transaction ROLLBACK; In this example, if the UPDATE statement for the second account fails, the ROLLBACK command undoes both operations, ensuring that no money is debited or credited and the database stays in a consistent state.","s":"Atomicity","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#atomicity","p":164},{"i":169,"t":"Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another. All the rules, constraints, and triggers in the database (such as foreign keys, unique constraints, etc.) must be preserved during the transaction. If any transaction operation violates the database rules (e.g., attempting to insert duplicate values into a column with a unique constraint), the transaction will be rolled back, and the database will return to its consistent state. Example: Imagine a constraint that ensures an account balance cannot go negative. If a transaction attempts to withdraw more than the available balance, the transaction will violate this rule and be rolled back. BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- This will fail if the balance goes below zero, and the transaction will be rolled back COMMIT;","s":"Consistency","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#consistency","p":164},{"i":171,"t":"Isolation refers to the level at which the operations of one transaction are isolated from the operations of other concurrent transactions. Different isolation levels control the visibility of intermediate transaction states to other transactions. PostgreSQL provides several isolation levels that determine how transactions interact with one another. The four isolation levels are: Read Uncommitted: Allows dirty reads. Transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. Read Committed: A transaction sees only committed data at the time it is read. It prevents dirty reads but still allows non-repeatable reads. Repeatable Read: Ensures that once a transaction reads a value, it will see the same value throughout the transaction, preventing dirty and non-repeatable reads. Phantom reads are still possible. Serializable: The highest isolation level, which ensures that transactions execute as if they Oure serialized (one after the other). This level prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. We can set the isolation level for a transaction in PostgreSQL using the SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL command. Example of setting isolation levels in PostgreSQL: -- Start transaction with Read Committed isolation level (default) BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Repeatable Read isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Serializable isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; -- Our queries here COMMIT; In each of these cases, PostgreSQL guarantees the level of isolation defined by the transaction's isolation level. For example, with READ COMMITTED, a transaction will see the latest committed data and avoid dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads are alloWed.","s":"Isolation","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#isolation","p":164},{"i":173,"t":"Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and survive any system crashes, poOur failures, or other interruptions. After a transaction commits, all changes made to the database are written to persistent storage (e.g., disk), ensuring that the data is not lost even if the system crashes shortly after the commit. Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it cannot be undone (except by explicitly using a rollback mechanism in a new transaction). Example: If a transaction has been committed to transfer money from one account to another, the changes (debiting one account and crediting another) will persist even if the database system crashes right after the commit. BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Debit UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- Credit COMMIT; -- Once this commit happens, the changes are permanent -- A crash after this point won't undo the changes","s":"Durability","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#durability","p":164},{"i":175,"t":"Atomicity: Ensures that all operations in a transaction are treated as a single unit.

This model is primarily associated with NoSQL databases and distributed systems that prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency, as defined by the CAP theorem. In an eventually consistent system, updates to the data are made available to all replicas, but they may not be immediately reflected across all replicas. The system will eventually propagate these changes to all nodes, ensuring that, over time, every replica will have the same data.","s":"Eventual Consistency","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#eventual-consistency","p":164},{"i":181,"t":"Temporary Inconsistency: At any point in time, different replicas of the data might have slightly different versions of the data.

Eventual Convergence: Over time, the system ensures that all updates are propagated across all nodes. Eventually, all replicas will become consistent, hence the term \"eventual consistency.\" High Availability: Eventual consistency allows the system to prioritize availability and continue operating even when some parts of the system are temporarily unavailable or partitioned. This is particularly useful for systems with high availability requirements, like global-scale Web applications. Concurrent Writes: Eventual consistency allows for concurrent updates to the same data from different locations or users.

Reliability: Transactions make sure that database operations are applied reliably, even in the event of system crashes.

Each table has a set of columns, which are called attributes. Each row in a table is called a tuple. The relational model was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. It is based on the mathematical concept of a relation, which is a set of ordered pairs. The relational model is used by most modern database management systems (DBMS). It is a very flexible model that can be used to represent a wide variety of data. The relational model is a way to represent data in a database. It uses tables to store data. Each table has rows and columns. Rows are called tuples. Columns are called attributes. The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. The relational model has the following components: Structure: The structure of a relational database is defined by a schema. A schema is a set of tables, columns, and constraints. Data: The data in a relational database is stored in tuples. Tuples are ordered sets of values. Integrity constraints: Integrity constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in a relational database. There are several types of integrity constraints, including primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and not null constraints. Operations: The operations that can be performed on a relational database include selection, projection, join, union, intersection, and difference. Primary Keys The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. It must be unique for each row in the table. It can be a single attribute or a combination of attributes. It is often used to join tables together. Foreign Keys The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. It allows you to create relationships between tables. It must match the data type of the primary key it references. It can be null if the relationship is optional. Constraints Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. They can be used to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include: NOT NULL: The attribute cannot be null. UNIQUE: The attribute must be unique for each row in the table. CHECK: The attribute must meet a certain condition. DEFAULT: The attribute will have a default value if it is not specified.","s":"Relational model:","u":"/docs/databases/database-systems/introduction","h":"#relational-model","p":501},{"i":513,"t":"Basic Operations Selection (σ): Selects tuples based on a condition.

Writes are handled efficiently in memory, as they avoid random disk I/O. Write-Ahead Log (WAL): Before data is added to the memtable, it’s written to a write-ahead log (WAL). This ensures durability, as the WAL records each write operation sequentially on disk. If there’s a system crash, the WAL allows the database to recover any uncommitted data. Flushing the Memtable: When the memtable reaches a configured size, it’s flushed to disk as an immutable, sorted file called an SSTable (Sorted String Table). This flush process is a sequential write, which is faster and reduces wear on the disk. Compaction: Over time, multiple SSTables are created, potentially containing outdated or duplicate records. Compaction merges SSTables, removes deleted and old data, and organizes records for better read efficiency. This reduces the number of files on disk, balancing storage space with performance. Write Amplification: Frequent compactions increase write amplification, as data may be written to disk multiple times.

Since the memtable is in memory and sorted, it can be quickly searched for the requested key. Checking SSTables on Disk: If the key isn’t found in the memtable, the search continues in the SSTables on disk. SSTables are stored as a series of files on disk, typically organized by levels or tiers to manage access patterns. Bloom Filters: Each SSTable has an associated Bloom filter. This probabilistic data structure helps quickly determine whether a key might exist in a specific SSTable. The Bloom filter check minimizes unnecessary reads by eliminating SSTables that don’t contain the requested key. Searching SSTables: If the Bloom filter indicates that a key might exist in an SSTable, the database reads the relevant SSTable(s). Within each SSTable, data is sorted, allowing binary search, which is efficient for finding keys. Merging Results: In cases where the key exists in multiple SSTables (due to updates or deletes), the database merges the results, applying any updates or deletes as necessary. The latest version of the record is returned to the user.

Optical Discs (e.g., CDs, DVDs): Access Time: 150-300 ms Slower than HDDs; uses lasers to read data. Magnetic Tape: Access Time: Seconds to minutes Primarily used for archival storage; very slow access due to sequential reading. Why is Storage Hierarchy Important? Performance Optimization: Data is stored at the appropriate level based on its usage frequency. Frequently accessed data is kept in faster storage, while less frequently accessed data is stored in slower, cheaper storage. Cost Optimization: By using a hierarchy, organizations can balance performance and cost by storing data at the most suitable level. Data Availability: Critical data can be replicated across multiple storage levels to ensure high availability and redundancy. Example of Storage Hierarchy in a Database System: Primary Storage: Active database buffers, query results, and frequently accessed data. Secondary Storage: Main database files, indexes, and temporary data. Tertiary Storage: Historical data, backups, and archived data. Key Factors Influencing Storage Hierarchy: Access Frequency: How often data is accessed. Data Size: The amount of data to be stored. Data Retention Requirements: How long data needs to be retained. Cost Constraints: Budgetary limitations. Emerging Trends: Cloud Storage: Leveraging external storage providers for scalable and flexible storage solutions. Hybrid Cloud Storage: Combining on-premises and cloud storage for optimal performance and cost. Object Storage: Designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data. Understanding the storage hierarchy is crucial for designing efficient and cost-effective storage systems in various applications, including databases, cloud computing, and data centers.","s":"Storage Hierarchy Access Speed","u":"/docs/databases/database-systems/database-storage","h":"#storage-hierarchy-access-speed","p":694},{"i":701,"t":"Sequential Access: Data is accessed in a linear order, starting from the beginning of a file.

Data Modification: Updates, inserts, and deletes data within the storage system. Concurrency Control: Ensures that multiple transactions can access and modify data simultaneously without conflicts. Recovery Management: Recovers the database to a consistent state in case of failures or errors. Components of the Storage Manager: Buffer Manager: Manages a cache of data pages in memory to improve performance. File Manager: Organizes data into files and manages file structures. Page Manager: Handles the allocation and deallocation of pages within files. Access Methods: Provides mechanisms for efficiently accessing data, such as B-trees, hash indexes, and sequential scans.

They are fixed-size blocks of data that are read from and written to disk. Pages provide a structured and efficient way to organize and manage data. Key Characteristics of Database Pages: Fixed Size: Pages have a predetermined size, typically measured in bytes. This ensures consistent data access and storage management. Header: The header section of a page contains metadata information, such as the page number, transaction ID, and flags indicating the page's status (e.g., dirty, free). Data Area: The data area stores the actual data, which can be organized in various ways depending on the database system and data structure. Free Space: Pages often include a free space area to accommodate insertions and updates without requiring the entire page to be rewritten. Oracle and some other databases can have different page sizes for each table. Page Management Techniques: Page Allocation: Determining which page to use for storing new data. This can be done using techniques like sequential allocation, linked allocation, or indexed allocation. Page Replacement: Deciding which page to remove from the buffer pool (in-memory cache) when a new page needs to be loaded. Common algorithms include LRU (Least Recently Used), FIFO (First-In-First-Out), and LFU (Least Frequently Used). Page Splitting and Merging: Handling situations where a page becomes full or nearly empty. Splitting a page creates two new pages, while merging combines two pages into one. Page Types: Data Pages: Store the actual data records. Index Pages: Store index entries that point to data pages, enabling efficient data retrieval. Metadata Pages: Store information about the database structure, such as table definitions, indexes, and constraints. Page-Based Storage Advantages: Efficiency: Pages provide a convenient size for reading and writing data to disk. Simplicity: They offer a uniform way to manage data storage. Performance: Page-based storage can improve performance by reducing the number of I/O operations required. Considerations: Page Size: The choice of page size can impact performance and storage efficiency. Larger pages may reduce the number of I/O operations but can also lead to wasted space if pages are not fully utilized. Also write operations can be slow if the page size is too large. Page Organization: The way data is organized within a page can affect retrieval efficiency. Techniques like B-trees, hash tables, and heap files are commonly used.

It's essentially a collection of free and used pages within a database file. The DBMS can locate a page on disk given a page id by using a linked list of pages or a page directory. Linked List: Header page holds pointers to a list of free pages and a list of data pages. However, if the DBMS is looking for a specific page, it has to do a sequential scan on the data page list until it finds the page it is looking for. Page Directory: DBMS maintains special pages, called page directory, to track locations of data pages, the amount of free space on each page, a list of free/empty pages and the page type. These special pages have one entry for each database object. Page Heap Algorithms: Different database systems use various algorithms to manage the page heap: First-Fit: The first free page that is large enough to accommodate the new data object is allocated. Best-Fit: The smallest free page that is large enough is allocated. Worst-Fit: The largest free page is allocated. The choice of algorithm can impact the performance and efficiency of the database system. For example, first-fit is often a good choice for simplicity and speed, but it can lead to fragmentation over time. Best-fit can reduce fragmentation but may require more overhead to find the best-fit page. Page Heap Fragmentation: Fragmentation occurs when free space is scattered across the page heap, resulting in small, non-contiguous free blocks. Fragmentation can reduce storage utilization and performance. To mitigate fragmentation, database systems may employ techniques like: Coalescing: Combining adjacent free pages into larger free blocks. Defragmentation: Reorganizing the data to consolidate free space and improve performance.

In a slotted page, a fixed-size header is followed by a variable-length data area. The header contains information about the number of slots and the offset of each slot within the data area. Key Components of a Slotted Page: Header: Number of Slots: The total number of slots in the page. Slot Directory: An array of slot descriptors, each containing the offset of the corresponding record and its length. Data Area: Stores the actual data records. Records can be of varying lengths and are stored contiguously. Advantages of Slotted Pages: Efficient Storage: Slotted pages allow for efficient storage of variable-length records. Flexible Record Insertion: New records can be inserted into free space within the page, reducing the need for page splits. Efficient Record Deletion: Deleted records can be marked as deleted without physically removing them from the page, allowing for potential reuse of the space. Disadvantages of Slotted Pages: Fragmentation: Over time, as records are inserted and deleted, fragmentation can occur, reducing storage utilization. Complexity: Slotted pages require more complex management compared to fixed-width record pages. Slotted Page Management: Slot Allocation: When a new record is inserted, the system selects a free slot and updates the slot directory. Slot Deallocation: When a record is deleted, the slot is marked as free, but the data may remain on the page until it is overwritten by a new record. Fragmentation Management: To minimize fragmentation, database systems may employ techniques like coalescing adjacent free slots or defragmenting the page.","s":"Tuple Oriented Storage - Slotted Pages","u":"/docs/databases/database-systems/database-storage","h":"#tuple-oriented-storage---slotted-pages","p":694},{"i":715,"t":"Record IDs (RIDs) are unique identifiers assigned to tuples (rows) in a database.

For example, MySQL's InnoDB storage engine uses RIDs to locate rows within clustered indexes. Usage: RIDs facilitate efficient data retrieval and support operations like updates and deletes by referencing specific tuples directly. NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB): Implementation: MongoDB utilizes ObjectIDs as unique identifiers for its documents. While not traditional RIDs, ObjectIDs serve a similar function by providing unique access points for documents. Usage: These IDs enable quick document retrieval and ensure that each document is uniquely identifiable across collections. Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis, Amazon DynamoDB): Implementation: In key-value databases, the key acts as a unique identifier for records. Although not RIDs in the classic sense, the keys function similarly by providing direct access to values. Usage: Keys allow for rapid data access without the need for additional indexing, making operations very efficient. Column-Family Stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra): Implementation: Cassandra uses a unique primary key for each row, which can be considered a form of RID. This key is crucial for directly accessing data within the distributed architecture. Usage: The primary key structure allows for efficient data retrieval and supports horizontal scalability, ensuring that data can be accessed quickly even in large datasets. Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j): Implementation: In Neo4j, every node and relationship has a unique internal identifier, functioning similarly to RIDs. These IDs allow for efficient traversal and querying of the graph structure.

Note that the DBMS does not need to store meta-data about the schema of the database here. Tuple Data: Actual data for attributes. Attributes are typically stored in the order that you specify them when you create the table. Most DBMSs do not allow a tuple to exceed the size of a page. Unique Identifier: Each tuple in the database is assigned a unique identifier. Most common: page id + (offset or slot). An application cannot rely on these ids to mean anything. Denormalized Tuple Data: If two tables are related, the DBMS can “pre-join” them, so the tables end up on the same page.

Examples: Calculate the running total of sales for each order: SELECT order_id, order_date, sales, SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total FROM orders; Equivalent using a lateral join: SELECT order_id, order_date, sales, (SELECT SUM(o2.sales) FROM orders o2 WHERE o2.order_date <= o1.order_date) AS running_total FROM orders AS o1; Find the most recent order for each customer: SELECT customer_id, (SELECT order_id FROM orders o2 WHERE o2.customer_id = o1.customer_id ORDER BY o2.order_date DESC LIMIT 1) AS most_recent_order FROM customers AS o1; Benefits of lateral joins: Improved readability and maintainability. Can be more efficient than correlated subqueries in certain cases. Provide a flexible way to perform calculations and lookups on a per-row basis. Limitations: Not supported in all SQL dialects.

It was designed with the idea of making software development easier and faster, especially for large-scale, distributed systems. Here are some of the key reasons why developers choose Go: Concurrency Model: Go’s built-in concurrency model, which uses goroutines (lightweight threads) and channels, makes it easier to write concurrent programs without worrying about the complexity of threads and synchronization mechanisms. Simplicity: The language focuses on simplicity. Its minimalistic syntax allows developers to quickly write and maintain code. There are no complex inheritance hierarchies, and the code is easy to read and understand. Performance: Go is a compiled language, and it produces highly efficient machine code, making it a great choice for performance-critical applications, especially those that need to handle high concurrency and throughput. Strong Standard Library: Go’s standard library is powerful and versatile. It includes packages for web development, file handling, networking, cryptography, and more. This reduces the need for third-party libraries and frameworks. Cross-Platform: Go compiles to machine code, which means it can run on any platform. With Go, developers can easily compile their applications for different operating systems and architectures. Built-in Tooling: Go comes with robust tooling, such as the built-in go command for testing, formatting, and dependency management. Tools like go fmt, go test, and go build streamline the development process.","s":"Why Use Go?","u":"/docs/programming-languages/go/introduction","h":"#why-use-go","p":1076},{"i":1081,"t":"Easy to Learn and Use: Go’s syntax is clean and straightforward, making it easy for developers to quickly pick up, even if they are coming from other languages.

Scalable Concurrency: Go’s concurrency model with goroutines and channels makes it easy to scale applications to handle a large number of tasks simultaneously without much complexity. Built-in Garbage Collection: Go has a powerful garbage collector that automatically manages memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks. Rich Ecosystem and Libraries: Go has a well-established ecosystem, including web frameworks (e.g., Gin, Echo), microservices tools (e.g., Go-Kit, Go-Micro), and cloud-native tools (e.g., Kubernetes).

While generics have been introduced in Go 1.18, their use still requires understanding specific syntax and trade-offs. Verbose Error Handling: Go’s error-handling pattern requires explicitly checking and handling errors in every function call, which some developers find verbose. This can lead to repetitive code. Limited GUI Support: Go is not as widely used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which means it lacks support for many UI-related libraries compared to other languages like Python or JavaScript. No Implicit Type Conversion: Go does not allow implicit type conversion (also known as coercion) between different types, which can be a bit restrictive for developers coming from more flexible languages like Python or JavaScript. Relatively Young Ecosystem: Although Go’s ecosystem is growing rapidly, there are still areas, especially in niche domains, where other languages like Python, Java, or C# might have a more mature ecosystem.","s":"Cons of Go","u":"/docs/programming-languages/go/introduction","h":"#cons-of-go","p":1076},{"i":1085,"t":"Many popular projects in the tech industry use Go because of its concurrency and performance advantages.

For example, Go has a minimalist object-oriented approach (no classes or inheritance) but provides powerful composition via interfaces and structs. Speed and Efficiency: Go’s emphasis on performance is evident in its design decisions. It compiles quickly, has a low memory footprint, and provides easy-to-use concurrency models to handle large-scale systems. Fostering Readable Code: Go encourages developers to write clear, readable, and idiomatic code. The language’s toolchain (e.g., go fmt) enforces coding style conventions, ensuring consistency across projects.

React was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook along with a community of developers. React focuses on creating interactive UIs by updating only the parts of the page that need to be changed, making the UI more efficient and responsive. React allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, reusable components. These components can manage their own state and render based on that state, ensuring that only the necessary components are re-rendered when data changes.","s":"Introduction","u":"/docs/frontend/react/introduction","h":"","p":1209},{"i":1212,"t":"JSX (JavaScript XML): React uses JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript, that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX is later compiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel. This makes the code more readable and closely mirrors how the UI is structured. Example: const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>; Components: Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component can be a function or a class, and it returns a UI representation based on the input (props) and internal state. Functional Components: Simpler components that are just JavaScript functions. Class Components: Components that are more powerful and allow for state management and lifecycle methods. Example of a functional component: function Greeting(props) { return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>; } Props (Properties): Props are read-only values passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to communicate with each other and provide dynamic content. State: State refers to data that changes over time within a component. It is mutable and can trigger a re-render when updated. In functional components, you can manage state using the useState hook. Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0); Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM (VDOM) to improve performance. Instead of updating the entire DOM for every change, React updates a virtual representation of the DOM, compares it with the actual DOM, and then only applies the minimal changes required. This process is known as reconciliation. Lifecycle Methods (for Class Components): In class components, lifecycle methods allow developers to run code at different stages of a component's life, such as when it is being mounted, updated, or unmounted. Common lifecycle methods: componentDidMount() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount() Hooks (for Functional Components): Hooks are functions that allow you to \"hook into\" React features from functional components. Common hooks include: useState() useEffect() useContext() useReducer() Hooks provide a more concise and powerful way to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components. React Router: React Router is a library that enables navigation between different views or pages in a React application, helping build single-page applications (SPAs) with dynamic routing.","s":"Key Concepts in React","u":"/docs/frontend/react/introduction","h":"#key-concepts-in-react","p":1209},{"i":1214,"t":"Component-Based Architecture: Encourages reusable, modular components, which makes the code more maintainable, readable, and testable. Declarative UI: React uses a declarative approach, where developers describe the UI state, and React ensures it is updated accordingly. This reduces the complexity of managing UI updates. Performance Optimization (Virtual DOM): The Virtual DOM optimizes rendering by minimizing direct updates to the actual DOM, improving the performance of applications, especially for larger projects. Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows from parent components to child components via props. This makes debugging easier as the data is predictable. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: React has a large and active community, with plenty of libraries, tools, and resources available to help developers. Cross-Platform Development: React Native, a framework based on React, allows developers to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using the same knowledge and codebase used for web development. SEO Friendly (with Server-Side Rendering): React can be rendered on the server side (using frameworks like Next.js), making it SEO-friendly. This helps in ensuring that search engines can crawl the content. Easy to Learn: React’s learning curve is relatively gentle for those who already have knowledge of JavaScript.

Boilerplate Code: React applications can sometimes have a lot of boilerplate code, especially when setting up complex configurations like state management, routing, and hooks. Too Many Choices for State Management: React itself doesn’t provide an out-of-the-box solution for complex state management. As a result, developers often need to choose between tools like Redux, Context API, MobX, or Recoil, which can add complexity to the development process.

Mobile Applications (React Native): With React Native, you can build cross-platform mobile applications for both iOS and Android, sharing much of the codebase between the web and mobile versions of an app. E-commerce Sites: React’s ability to handle large, dynamic datasets and re-render only changed parts of the UI makes it a good fit for e-commerce platforms where product catalogs, user reviews, and shopping carts need frequent updates. Content Management Systems (CMS): React can be used to build highly dynamic CMS where content changes often, and the UI needs to be updated in real-time without full page reloads.

Disadvantages: First access is always slower (cache miss). Use Case: Database query result caching. Write-Through: Description: Data is written to the cache and the source database simultaneously. How it Works: Every write operation updates both the cache and the database. Advantages: Ensures cache consistency with the database. Disadvantages: Slower write operations due to dual writes. Use Case: Scenarios requiring strong consistency. Write-Back (Lazy Write): Description: Data is written to the cache, and the database is updated asynchronously.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: DNS queries and responses are typically sent in plaintext, which can be intercepted and modified by attackers. Solution: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT): These protocols encrypt DNS traffic, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept or manipulate queries. DDoS Attacks: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can overwhelm DNS servers, rendering them unavailable.

Dynamic Adjustment: TCP adjusts the window size dynamically based on the receiver’s advertised capacity. If the receiver’s buffer fills up, it can reduce the window size to zero, pausing data transmission until it is ready to accept more data.

Fast Retransmit: Upon receiving three duplicate ACKs, the sender retransmits the lost packet immediately without waiting for a timeout. Fast Recovery: Instead of resetting to slow start, TCP reduces the congestion window size to half and enters congestion avoidance mode to recover from congestion quickly.
