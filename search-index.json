If any operation in the transaction fails (e.g., a UPDATE fails), the entire transaction will be rolled back, and no changes will be applied to the database. A rollback ensures the database is restored to its state before the transaction started. Example: Consider a transaction that involves transferring money from one account to another. If any step fails, both operations (debit and credit) should be rolled back. BEGIN; -- Debit from account 1 UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- If an error occurs, roll back the transaction -- Let's assume the credit operation fails, and We roll back UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- If something goes wrong, rollback the transaction ROLLBACK; In this example, if the UPDATE statement for the second account fails, the ROLLBACK command undoes both operations, ensuring that no money is debited or credited and the database stays in a consistent state.","s":"Atomicity","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#atomicity","p":146},{"i":151,"t":"Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another.

Different isolation levels control the visibility of intermediate transaction states to other transactions. PostgreSQL provides several isolation levels that determine how transactions interact with one another. The four isolation levels are: Read Uncommitted: Allows dirty reads. Transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. Read Committed: A transaction sees only committed data at the time it is read. It prevents dirty reads but still allows non-repeatable reads. Repeatable Read: Ensures that once a transaction reads a value, it will see the same value throughout the transaction, preventing dirty and non-repeatable reads. Phantom reads are still possible. Serializable: The highest isolation level, which ensures that transactions execute as if they Oure serialized (one after the other). This level prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. We can set the isolation level for a transaction in PostgreSQL using the SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL command. Example of setting isolation levels in PostgreSQL: -- Start transaction with Read Committed isolation level (default) BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Repeatable Read isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Serializable isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; -- Our queries here COMMIT; In each of these cases, PostgreSQL guarantees the level of isolation defined by the transaction's isolation level.

Eventually, all replicas will become consistent, hence the term \"eventual consistency.\" High Availability: Eventual consistency allows the system to prioritize availability and continue operating even when some parts of the system are temporarily unavailable or partitioned. This is particularly useful for systems with high availability requirements, like global-scale Web applications.

Reliability: Transactions make sure that database operations are applied reliably, even in the event of system crashes.

They ensure that each transaction works as if it Oure the only transaction in the system, preventing conflicts and maintaining consistency. Error Handling: If an error occurs during a transaction, the changes can be rolled back, and the database can return to its previous consistent state.

Header: The header section of a page contains metadata information, such as the page number, transaction ID, and flags indicating the page's status (e.g., dirty, free). Data Area: The data area stores the actual data, which can be organized in various ways depending on the database system and data structure. Free Space: Pages often include a free space area to accommodate insertions and updates without requiring the entire page to be rewritten. Oracle and some other databases can have different page sizes for each table. Page Management Techniques: Page Allocation: Determining which page to use for storing new data. This can be done using techniques like sequential allocation, linked allocation, or indexed allocation. Page Replacement: Deciding which page to remove from the buffer pool (in-memory cache) when a new page needs to be loaded. Common algorithms include LRU (Least Recently Used), FIFO (First-In-First-Out), and LFU (Least Frequently Used). Page Splitting and Merging: Handling situations where a page becomes full or nearly empty. Splitting a page creates two new pages, while merging combines two pages into one. Page Types: Data Pages: Store the actual data records. Index Pages: Store index entries that point to data pages, enabling efficient data retrieval. Metadata Pages: Store information about the database structure, such as table definitions, indexes, and constraints.

Linked List: Header page holds pointers to a list of free pages and a list of data pages. However, if the DBMS is looking for a specific page, it has to do a sequential scan on the data page list until it finds the page it is looking for. Page Directory: DBMS maintains special pages, called page directory, to track locations of data pages, the amount of free space on each page, a list of free/empty pages and the page type. These special pages have one entry for each database object. Page Heap Algorithms: Different database systems use various algorithms to manage the page heap: First-Fit: The first free page that is large enough to accommodate the new data object is allocated. Best-Fit: The smallest free page that is large enough is allocated. Worst-Fit: The largest free page is allocated. The choice of algorithm can impact the performance and efficiency of the database system. For example, first-fit is often a good choice for simplicity and speed, but it can lead to fragmentation over time. Best-fit can reduce fragmentation but may require more overhead to find the best-fit page. Page Heap Fragmentation: Fragmentation occurs when free space is scattered across the page heap, resulting in small, non-contiguous free blocks. Fragmentation can reduce storage utilization and performance.

Attributes are typically stored in the order that you specify them when you create the table. Most DBMSs do not allow a tuple to exceed the size of a page. Unique Identifier: Each tuple in the database is assigned a unique identifier. Most common: page id + (offset or slot). An application cannot rely on these ids to mean anything. Denormalized Tuple Data: If two tables are related, the DBMS can “pre-join” them, so the tables end up on the same page. This makes reads faster since the DBMS only has to load in one page rather than two separate pages.

Writes are handled efficiently in memory, as they avoid random disk I/O. Write-Ahead Log (WAL): Before data is added to the memtable, it’s written to a write-ahead log (WAL). This ensures durability, as the WAL records each write operation sequentially on disk. If there’s a system crash, the WAL allows the database to recover any uncommitted data. Flushing the Memtable: When the memtable reaches a configured size, it’s flushed to disk as an immutable, sorted file called an SSTable (Sorted String Table). This flush process is a sequential write, which is faster and reduces wear on the disk. Compaction: Over time, multiple SSTables are created, potentially containing outdated or duplicate records.

Checking SSTables on Disk: If the key isn’t found in the memtable, the search continues in the SSTables on disk. SSTables are stored as a series of files on disk, typically organized by levels or tiers to manage access patterns. Bloom Filters: Each SSTable has an associated Bloom filter. This probabilistic data structure helps quickly determine whether a key might exist in a specific SSTable. The Bloom filter check minimizes unnecessary reads by eliminating SSTables that don’t contain the requested key. Searching SSTables: If the Bloom filter indicates that a key might exist in an SSTable, the database reads the relevant SSTable(s). Within each SSTable, data is sorted, allowing binary search, which is efficient for finding keys. Merging Results: In cases where the key exists in multiple SSTables (due to updates or deletes), the database merges the results, applying any updates or deletes as necessary. The latest version of the record is returned to the user.

A Vector Index provides a way to efficiently query such data based on similarity, typically using distance metrics like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or Manhattan distance. A Vector Index maps vector representations (usually of high-dimensional data) to their corresponding entries in the database, allowing for fast retrieval of similar vectors based on a similarity measure. These indexes are widely used in search engines, recommender systems, image recognition systems, and natural language processing tasks, where items (e.g., documents, images, or products) are represented by vectors in a high-dimensional space.

Each table has a set of columns, which are called attributes. Each row in a table is called a tuple. The relational model was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. It is based on the mathematical concept of a relation, which is a set of ordered pairs. The relational model is used by most modern database management systems (DBMS). It is a very flexible model that can be used to represent a wide variety of data. The relational model is a way to represent data in a database. It uses tables to store data. Each table has rows and columns. Rows are called tuples. Columns are called attributes. The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. The relational model has the following components: Structure: The structure of a relational database is defined by a schema. A schema is a set of tables, columns, and constraints. Data: The data in a relational database is stored in tuples. Tuples are ordered sets of values. Integrity constraints: Integrity constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in a relational database. There are several types of integrity constraints, including primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and not null constraints. Operations: The operations that can be performed on a relational database include selection, projection, join, union, intersection, and difference. Primary Keys The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. It must be unique for each row in the table. It can be a single attribute or a combination of attributes. It is often used to join tables together. Foreign Keys The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. It allows you to create relationships between tables. It must match the data type of the primary key it references. It can be null if the relationship is optional. Constraints Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. They can be used to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include: NOT NULL: The attribute cannot be null. UNIQUE: The attribute must be unique for each row in the table.

JSX is later compiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel. This makes the code more readable and closely mirrors how the UI is structured. Example: const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>; Components: Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component can be a function or a class, and it returns a UI representation based on the input (props) and internal state. Functional Components: Simpler components that are just JavaScript functions. Class Components: Components that are more powerful and allow for state management and lifecycle methods. Example of a functional component: function Greeting(props) { return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>; } Props (Properties): Props are read-only values passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to communicate with each other and provide dynamic content. State: State refers to data that changes over time within a component. It is mutable and can trigger a re-render when updated. In functional components, you can manage state using the useState hook. Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0); Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM (VDOM) to improve performance. Instead of updating the entire DOM for every change, React updates a virtual representation of the DOM, compares it with the actual DOM, and then only applies the minimal changes required. This process is known as reconciliation. Lifecycle Methods (for Class Components): In class components, lifecycle methods allow developers to run code at different stages of a component's life, such as when it is being mounted, updated, or unmounted. Common lifecycle methods: componentDidMount() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount() Hooks (for Functional Components): Hooks are functions that allow you to \"hook into\" React features from functional components. Common hooks include: useState() useEffect() useContext() useReducer() Hooks provide a more concise and powerful way to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

Performance Optimization (Virtual DOM): The Virtual DOM optimizes rendering by minimizing direct updates to the actual DOM, improving the performance of applications, especially for larger projects.

Too Many Choices for State Management: React itself doesn’t provide an out-of-the-box solution for complex state management. As a result, developers often need to choose between tools like Redux, Context API, MobX, or Recoil, which can add complexity to the development process.

Dynamic Web Applications: React is well-suited for applications that require frequent UI updates based on changing data, such as dashboards, social media platforms, and news sites. Mobile Applications (React Native): With React Native, you can build cross-platform mobile applications for both iOS and Android, sharing much of the codebase between the web and mobile versions of an app. E-commerce Sites: React’s ability to handle large, dynamic datasets and re-render only changed parts of the UI makes it a good fit for e-commerce platforms where product catalogs, user reviews, and shopping carts need frequent updates. Content Management Systems (CMS): React can be used to build highly dynamic CMS where content changes often, and the UI needs to be updated in real-time without full page reloads. Interactive User Interfaces: React excels in scenarios where user interactions, such as animations, form validations, and dynamic updates, need to be handled efficiently. Real-Time Applications: React can be used to build chat applications, collaborative platforms, or any application where real-time data needs to be displayed or updated (e.g., live sports scoreboards).","s":"Use Cases of React","u":"/docs/frontend/react/introduction","h":"#use-cases-of-react","p":604},{"i":615,"t":"SQL is a computer language used to communicate and manage data within a relational database.

The handleChange function updates the state whenever the user types in the input field. The form submission is handled by the handleSubmit function, which displays the current state (name).","s":"Form Handling","u":"/docs/frontend/react/foundation","h":"#form-handling","p":670},{"i":708,"t":"The git config command is used to configure Git settings, including user information, repository-specific settings, and system-wide configurations.

The commit is stored in Git's object database as a commit object, and it points to a tree object, which in turn points to blob objects (files). A commit object typically contains the following: Commit Metadata: Author name and email Timestamp of the commit Commit message Tree Object: A reference to the tree object that represents the state of the file system at the time of the commit. Parent Commits: A reference to one or more parent commits (for example, in the case of merges, multiple parent commits are present). The commit object is created by Git when a new commit is made, and it is identified by a SHA-1 hash that uniquely identifies that specific commit. Commit Object Example: commit <sha1-hash> tree <sha1-hash of tree object> parent <sha1-hash of parent commit> author <name> <email> <timestamp> committer <name> <email> <timestamp> <commit message> The commit object points to a tree object (which represents the snapshot of the files), and each file in the tree object is represented by a blob object (holding the file's content).","s":"Commit Storage and Structure","u":"/docs/git/git-internals","h":"#commit-storage-and-structure","p":828},{"i":836,"t":"Creating a Commit: When you execute git commit, Git first creates a snapshot of the staged changes and stores the result as a tree object (which contains references to the blobs representing individual files).

Hashing: Git calculates the SHA-1 hash of the commit object and stores it in the .git/objects directory. The commit’s SHA-1 hash is a cryptographic representation of all the data associated with that commit. Referencing Commits: After the commit is created, Git stores the commit’s SHA-1 hash in the .git/refs/heads/ directory, under the branch name (e.g., master or main).

The remaining 38 characters are the object filename (e.g., .git/objects/ab/cde1234...). Git uses a pack file format to optimize storage.

It was designed with the idea of making software development easier and faster, especially for large-scale, distributed systems. Here are some of the key reasons why developers choose Go: Concurrency Model: Go’s built-in concurrency model, which uses goroutines (lightweight threads) and channels, makes it easier to write concurrent programs without worrying about the complexity of threads and synchronization mechanisms. Simplicity: The language focuses on simplicity. Its minimalistic syntax allows developers to quickly write and maintain code. There are no complex inheritance hierarchies, and the code is easy to read and understand. Performance: Go is a compiled language, and it produces highly efficient machine code, making it a great choice for performance-critical applications, especially those that need to handle high concurrency and throughput. Strong Standard Library: Go’s standard library is powerful and versatile. It includes packages for web development, file handling, networking, cryptography, and more. This reduces the need for third-party libraries and frameworks. Cross-Platform: Go compiles to machine code, which means it can run on any platform. With Go, developers can easily compile their applications for different operating systems and architectures. Built-in Tooling: Go comes with robust tooling, such as the built-in go command for testing, formatting, and dependency management. Tools like go fmt, go test, and go build streamline the development process.","s":"Why Use Go?","u":"/docs/programming-languages/go/introduction","h":"#why-use-go","p":958},{"i":963,"t":"Easy to Learn and Use: Go’s syntax is clean and straightforward, making it easy for developers to quickly pick up, even if they are coming from other languages. High Performance: Go is statically typed and compiled, which makes it fast, with performance close to that of C/C++ but with a more modern, user-friendly approach. Scalable Concurrency: Go’s concurrency model with goroutines and channels makes it easy to scale applications to handle a large number of tasks simultaneously without much complexity. Built-in Garbage Collection: Go has a powerful garbage collector that automatically manages memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks. Rich Ecosystem and Libraries: Go has a well-established ecosystem, including web frameworks (e.g., Gin, Echo), microservices tools (e.g., Go-Kit, Go-Micro), and cloud-native tools (e.g., Kubernetes).

While generics have been introduced in Go 1.18, their use still requires understanding specific syntax and trade-offs. Verbose Error Handling: Go’s error-handling pattern requires explicitly checking and handling errors in every function call, which some developers find verbose. This can lead to repetitive code. Limited GUI Support: Go is not as widely used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which means it lacks support for many UI-related libraries compared to other languages like Python or JavaScript. No Implicit Type Conversion: Go does not allow implicit type conversion (also known as coercion) between different types, which can be a bit restrictive for developers coming from more flexible languages like Python or JavaScript. Relatively Young Ecosystem: Although Go’s ecosystem is growing rapidly, there are still areas, especially in niche domains, where other languages like Python, Java, or C# might have a more mature ecosystem.","s":"Cons of Go","u":"/docs/programming-languages/go/introduction","h":"#cons-of-go","p":958},{"i":967,"t":"Many popular projects in the tech industry use Go because of its concurrency and performance advantages.

For example, Go has a minimalist object-oriented approach (no classes or inheritance) but provides powerful composition via interfaces and structs. Speed and Efficiency: Go’s emphasis on performance is evident in its design decisions. It compiles quickly, has a low memory footprint, and provides easy-to-use concurrency models to handle large-scale systems. Fostering Readable Code: Go encourages developers to write clear, readable, and idiomatic code. The language’s toolchain (e.g., go fmt) enforces coding style conventions, ensuring consistency across projects.

Recursive Resolver: If the record is not found, the request is forwarded to a recursive DNS resolver (usually provided by the ISP). Root Server Query: The recursive resolver queries one of the root DNS servers to find the TLD nameserver. TLD Server Query: The resolver queries the TLD nameserver (e.g., .com) to get the authoritative DNS server for the domain. Authoritative DNS Server: The authoritative DNS server for the domain provides the IP address (or other DNS records) for the domain. Final Response: The recursive resolver sends the resolved IP address back to the user's device, which can now connect to the website.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: DNS queries and responses are typically sent in plaintext, which can be intercepted and modified by attackers. Solution: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT): These protocols encrypt DNS traffic, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept or manipulate queries. DDoS Attacks: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can overwhelm DNS servers, rendering them unavailable.

Stateless Communication: DNS queries are simple request-response interactions, where the stateless nature of UDP is sufficient.

ARP is crucial because, even though devices use IP addresses to send data packets, actual delivery is based on the MAC address of the device. ARP Functionality​ When a device on the network needs to send data to another device within the same local network, it must first determine the MAC address associated with the destination device’s IP address.

ARP Reply: The device with the matching IP address responds directly to the sender with its MAC address. This reply is sent as a unicast message, so only the requesting device receives it.

Here's how it works in detail: Public Parameters: Both parties agree on a large prime number p (modulus) and a base g (generator), which are publicly known. These values can be reused for multiple sessions. Private Key Generation: Each party generates a private key: Party A chooses a private key a (a large random number). Party B chooses a private key b (another large random number). Compute Public Keys: Both parties calculate their public keys using the formula: Party A computes A = g^a mod p and sends A to Party B. Party B computes B = g^b mod p and sends B to Party A. Shared Secret Derivation: Each party uses the other’s public key and their private key to compute the shared secret: Party A computes S = B^a mod p. Party B computes S = A^b mod p. Both computations yield the same result because (g^b)^a mod p = (g^a)^b mod p. Result: The shared secret S is now known to both parties but remains unknown to eavesdroppers, as they would need to solve the discrete logarithm problem, which is computationally infeasible for large values of p.","s":"Diffie-Hellman Algorithm","u":"/docs/system-design/networking/tls","h":"#diffie-hellman-algorithm","p":2042},{"i":2068,"t":"What is it?

Steps in DHE: The client and server agree on public parameters p and g. Both parties generate temporary private keys (a and b) and compute corresponding public keys (A and B). Public keys are exchanged, and the shared secret is derived using the same steps as the basic Diffie-Hellman algorithm.

Efficiency: Faster computations and reduced overhead, making it suitable for devices with limited resources. Steps in ECDHE: Both parties agree on an elliptic curve and a generator point G on that curve. Each party generates a private key (random scalar) and computes a public key by multiplying the private key with the generator point. Public keys are exchanged. Each party computes the shared secret by multiplying their private key with the other party's public key.
