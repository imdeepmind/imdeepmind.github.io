If any operation in the transaction fails (e.g., a UPDATE fails), the entire transaction will be rolled back, and no changes will be applied to the database. A rollback ensures the database is restored to its state before the transaction started. Example: Consider a transaction that involves transferring money from one account to another. If any step fails, both operations (debit and credit) should be rolled back. BEGIN; -- Debit from account 1 UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- If an error occurs, roll back the transaction -- Let's assume the credit operation fails, and We roll back UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- If something goes wrong, rollback the transaction ROLLBACK; In this example, if the UPDATE statement for the second account fails, the ROLLBACK command undoes both operations, ensuring that no money is debited or credited and the database stays in a consistent state.","s":"Atomicity","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#atomicity","p":286},{"i":291,"t":"Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another.

Different isolation levels control the visibility of intermediate transaction states to other transactions. PostgreSQL provides several isolation levels that determine how transactions interact with one another. The four isolation levels are: Read Uncommitted: Allows dirty reads. Transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. Read Committed: A transaction sees only committed data at the time it is read. It prevents dirty reads but still allows non-repeatable reads. Repeatable Read: Ensures that once a transaction reads a value, it will see the same value throughout the transaction, preventing dirty and non-repeatable reads. Phantom reads are still possible. Serializable: The highest isolation level, which ensures that transactions execute as if they Oure serialized (one after the other). This level prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. We can set the isolation level for a transaction in PostgreSQL using the SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL command. Example of setting isolation levels in PostgreSQL: -- Start transaction with Read Committed isolation level (default) BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Repeatable Read isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Serializable isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; -- Our queries here COMMIT; In each of these cases, PostgreSQL guarantees the level of isolation defined by the transaction's isolation level.

Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it cannot be undone (except by explicitly using a rollback mechanism in a new transaction). Example: If a transaction has been committed to transfer money from one account to another, the changes (debiting one account and crediting another) will persist even if the database system crashes right after the commit. BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Debit UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- Credit COMMIT; -- Once this commit happens, the changes are permanent -- A crash after this point won't undo the changes","s":"Durability","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#durability","p":286},{"i":297,"t":"Atomicity: Ensures that all operations in a transaction are treated as a single unit.

Eventually, all replicas will become consistent, hence the term \"eventual consistency.\" High Availability: Eventual consistency allows the system to prioritize availability and continue operating even when some parts of the system are temporarily unavailable or partitioned.

Magnetic Tape: Access Time: Seconds to minutes Primarily used for archival storage; very slow access due to sequential reading. Why is Storage Hierarchy Important? Performance Optimization: Data is stored at the appropriate level based on its usage frequency. Frequently accessed data is kept in faster storage, while less frequently accessed data is stored in slower, cheaper storage. Cost Optimization: By using a hierarchy, organizations can balance performance and cost by storing data at the most suitable level.

They are fixed-size blocks of data that are read from and written to disk. Pages provide a structured and efficient way to organize and manage data. Key Characteristics of Database Pages: Fixed Size: Pages have a predetermined size, typically measured in bytes. This ensures consistent data access and storage management. Header: The header section of a page contains metadata information, such as the page number, transaction ID, and flags indicating the page's status (e.g., dirty, free). Data Area: The data area stores the actual data, which can be organized in various ways depending on the database system and data structure. Free Space: Pages often include a free space area to accommodate insertions and updates without requiring the entire page to be rewritten. Oracle and some other databases can have different page sizes for each table. Page Management Techniques: Page Allocation: Determining which page to use for storing new data. This can be done using techniques like sequential allocation, linked allocation, or indexed allocation. Page Replacement: Deciding which page to remove from the buffer pool (in-memory cache) when a new page needs to be loaded. Common algorithms include LRU (Least Recently Used), FIFO (First-In-First-Out), and LFU (Least Frequently Used). Page Splitting and Merging: Handling situations where a page becomes full or nearly empty. Splitting a page creates two new pages, while merging combines two pages into one. Page Types: Data Pages: Store the actual data records. Index Pages: Store index entries that point to data pages, enabling efficient data retrieval. Metadata Pages: Store information about the database structure, such as table definitions, indexes, and constraints. Page-Based Storage Advantages: Efficiency: Pages provide a convenient size for reading and writing data to disk. Simplicity: They offer a uniform way to manage data storage. Performance: Page-based storage can improve performance by reducing the number of I/O operations required. Considerations: Page Size: The choice of page size can impact performance and storage efficiency. Larger pages may reduce the number of I/O operations but can also lead to wasted space if pages are not fully utilized. Also write operations can be slow if the page size is too large. Page Organization: The way data is organized within a page can affect retrieval efficiency. Techniques like B-trees, hash tables, and heap files are commonly used.

It's essentially a collection of free and used pages within a database file. The DBMS can locate a page on disk given a page id by using a linked list of pages or a page directory. Linked List: Header page holds pointers to a list of free pages and a list of data pages. However, if the DBMS is looking for a specific page, it has to do a sequential scan on the data page list until it finds the page it is looking for. Page Directory: DBMS maintains special pages, called page directory, to track locations of data pages, the amount of free space on each page, a list of free/empty pages and the page type. These special pages have one entry for each database object. Page Heap Algorithms: Different database systems use various algorithms to manage the page heap: First-Fit: The first free page that is large enough to accommodate the new data object is allocated. Best-Fit: The smallest free page that is large enough is allocated. Worst-Fit: The largest free page is allocated. The choice of algorithm can impact the performance and efficiency of the database system. For example, first-fit is often a good choice for simplicity and speed, but it can lead to fragmentation over time. Best-fit can reduce fragmentation but may require more overhead to find the best-fit page. Page Heap Fragmentation: Fragmentation occurs when free space is scattered across the page heap, resulting in small, non-contiguous free blocks. Fragmentation can reduce storage utilization and performance. To mitigate fragmentation, database systems may employ techniques like: Coalescing: Combining adjacent free pages into larger free blocks. Defragmentation: Reorganizing the data to consolidate free space and improve performance.

Key Components of a Slotted Page: Header: Number of Slots: The total number of slots in the page. Slot Directory: An array of slot descriptors, each containing the offset of the corresponding record and its length. Data Area: Stores the actual data records. Records can be of varying lengths and are stored contiguously. Advantages of Slotted Pages: Efficient Storage: Slotted pages allow for efficient storage of variable-length records. Flexible Record Insertion: New records can be inserted into free space within the page, reducing the need for page splits. Efficient Record Deletion: Deleted records can be marked as deleted without physically removing them from the page, allowing for potential reuse of the space. Disadvantages of Slotted Pages: Fragmentation: Over time, as records are inserted and deleted, fragmentation can occur, reducing storage utilization. Complexity: Slotted pages require more complex management compared to fixed-width record pages. Slotted Page Management: Slot Allocation: When a new record is inserted, the system selects a free slot and updates the slot directory.

NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB): Implementation: MongoDB utilizes ObjectIDs as unique identifiers for its documents. While not traditional RIDs, ObjectIDs serve a similar function by providing unique access points for documents. Usage: These IDs enable quick document retrieval and ensure that each document is uniquely identifiable across collections. Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis, Amazon DynamoDB): Implementation: In key-value databases, the key acts as a unique identifier for records. Although not RIDs in the classic sense, the keys function similarly by providing direct access to values. Usage: Keys allow for rapid data access without the need for additional indexing, making operations very efficient. Column-Family Stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra): Implementation: Cassandra uses a unique primary key for each row, which can be considered a form of RID.

Usage: The primary key structure allows for efficient data retrieval and supports horizontal scalability, ensuring that data can be accessed quickly even in large datasets. Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j): Implementation: In Neo4j, every node and relationship has a unique internal identifier, functioning similarly to RIDs.

Unique Identifier: Each tuple in the database is assigned a unique identifier. Most common: page id + (offset or slot). An application cannot rely on these ids to mean anything. Denormalized Tuple Data: If two tables are related, the DBMS can “pre-join” them, so the tables end up on the same page.

Atomicity: The atomic nature of a transaction means that all operations within the transaction are treated as a single unit. If one operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring that partial updates do not corrupt the database. Concurrency: In multi-user environments, transactions help manage concurrent access to the database. They ensure that each transaction works as if it Oure the only transaction in the system, preventing conflicts and maintaining consistency. Error Handling: If an error occurs during a transaction, the changes can be rolled back, and the database can return to its previous consistent state. This helps to avoid partial updates or data corruption. Simplified Development: Using transactions simplifies the development of complex operations by allowing developers to group multiple SQL statements into a single unit of work. This eliminates the need for manually managing intermediate states.","s":"Advantages of Transactions","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/transactions","h":"#advantages-of-transactions","p":475},{"i":490,"t":"In multi-user environments, where multiple transactions can occur simultaneously, it's important to manage how transactions interact with each other to avoid conflicts.

Table-level locks: Prevent any other transaction from accessing the entire table while a transaction is modifying it.

Levels and Compaction: Data is stored in multiple levels, and when the memtable reaches a certain size, it’s flushed to disk as a new file (often called an SSTable).

Writes are handled efficiently in memory, as they avoid random disk I/O. Write-Ahead Log (WAL): Before data is added to the memtable, it’s written to a write-ahead log (WAL). This ensures durability, as the WAL records each write operation sequentially on disk. If there’s a system crash, the WAL allows the database to recover any uncommitted data. Flushing the Memtable: When the memtable reaches a configured size, it’s flushed to disk as an immutable, sorted file called an SSTable (Sorted String Table). This flush process is a sequential write, which is faster and reduces wear on the disk. Compaction: Over time, multiple SSTables are created, potentially containing outdated or duplicate records. Compaction merges SSTables, removes deleted and old data, and organizes records for better read efficiency. This reduces the number of files on disk, balancing storage space with performance.

Since the memtable is in memory and sorted, it can be quickly searched for the requested key. Checking SSTables on Disk: If the key isn’t found in the memtable, the search continues in the SSTables on disk. SSTables are stored as a series of files on disk, typically organized by levels or tiers to manage access patterns. Bloom Filters: Each SSTable has an associated Bloom filter. This probabilistic data structure helps quickly determine whether a key might exist in a specific SSTable. The Bloom filter check minimizes unnecessary reads by eliminating SSTables that don’t contain the requested key. Searching SSTables: If the Bloom filter indicates that a key might exist in an SSTable, the database reads the relevant SSTable(s). Within each SSTable, data is sorted, allowing binary search, which is efficient for finding keys. Merging Results: In cases where the key exists in multiple SSTables (due to updates or deletes), the database merges the results, applying any updates or deletes as necessary. The latest version of the record is returned to the user.

Each table has a set of columns, which are called attributes. Each row in a table is called a tuple. The relational model was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. It is based on the mathematical concept of a relation, which is a set of ordered pairs. The relational model is used by most modern database management systems (DBMS). It is a very flexible model that can be used to represent a wide variety of data. The relational model is a way to represent data in a database. It uses tables to store data. Each table has rows and columns. Rows are called tuples. Columns are called attributes. The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. The relational model has the following components: Structure: The structure of a relational database is defined by a schema. A schema is a set of tables, columns, and constraints. Data: The data in a relational database is stored in tuples. Tuples are ordered sets of values. Integrity constraints: Integrity constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in a relational database. There are several types of integrity constraints, including primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and not null constraints. Operations: The operations that can be performed on a relational database include selection, projection, join, union, intersection, and difference. Primary Keys The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. It must be unique for each row in the table. It can be a single attribute or a combination of attributes. It is often used to join tables together. Foreign Keys The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. It allows you to create relationships between tables. It must match the data type of the primary key it references. It can be null if the relationship is optional. Constraints Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. They can be used to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include: NOT NULL: The attribute cannot be null. UNIQUE: The attribute must be unique for each row in the table. CHECK: The attribute must meet a certain condition.

Probabilistic Nature: Skip lists are probabilistic in nature because the level structure is determined by randomization.

Insertion: When inserting an element, the list chooses a level for the element, and it’s inserted into the appropriate position at each level. A random coin flip determines whether the element will be added to higher levels. If the coin flip results in a “head,” the element is inserted into the next higher level; otherwise, it remains in the current level. Searching: Searching begins from the topmost level and proceeds to lower levels as needed. At each level, the search moves horizontally to find the correct element or the closest smaller element, and then it drops down to the next level.

In such systems, data is often represented as vectors (or embeddings), and traditional indexing methods (like inverted indexes) may not work efficiently for high-dimensional spaces. A Vector Index provides a way to efficiently query such data based on similarity, typically using distance metrics like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or Manhattan distance. A Vector Index maps vector representations (usually of high-dimensional data) to their corresponding entries in the database, allowing for fast retrieval of similar vectors based on a similarity measure. These indexes are widely used in search engines, recommender systems, image recognition systems, and natural language processing tasks, where items (e.g., documents, images, or products) are represented by vectors in a high-dimensional space. Common tasks that benefit from vector indexing include: Nearest Neighbor Search (k-NN): Finding vectors that are closest to a query vector. Similarity Search: Retrieving items that are most similar to a given item. Cluster Analysis: Grouping similar items together in high-dimensional spaces.","s":"Vector Index","u":"/docs/databases/database-systems/vector-index","h":"","p":767},{"i":770,"t":"Brute Force Search: A simple method where all vectors are compared to the query vector, calculating the distance between each vector and the query. Although accurate, this method becomes inefficient as the dataset grows large, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. Tree-Based Indexes: KD-Tree: A binary tree structure used to partition space into regions, improving search speed by recursively splitting the data along different dimensions. It’s efficient in lower-dimensional spaces but struggles as the dimensionality increases (curse of dimensionality). Ball Tree: A tree-based structure similar to KD-Tree but organizes data into spheres (balls), which can handle higher-dimensional data better than KD-Trees. Cover Tree: A more general tree-based method that works well for high-dimensional spaces and is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality. Hashing-Based Indexes: Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH): A technique used for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. LSH maps similar items to the same hash bucket with high probability, allowing for quick searches by reducing the number of candidates to check. Product Quantization: Used in combination with LSH to reduce the dimensionality of vectors by splitting the vector space into several subspaces and quantizing them independently. Graph-Based Indexes: Navigable Small World Graphs (NSW): A graph structure used for indexing vectors that can approximate nearest neighbors quickly. It builds a graph where nodes (vectors) are connected based on similarity, and traversal through the graph leads to the nearest neighbors.

Parent Commits: A reference to one or more parent commits (for example, in the case of merges, multiple parent commits are present).

Typically, you'll merge a feature branch into the main branch (e.g., main or develop). The merge process looks at the commit histories of both branches and merges them. How it works: When you perform a merge, Git looks at the common ancestor (the commit where both branches diverged) and compares the changes made in both branches. If there are no conflicts, it combines the changes into a new merge commit. Merge Commit: A new commit is created to record the merge operation. This commit has two parent commits: the previous commit on the target branch and the last commit on the source branch.

How it works: If the target branch is directly behind the source branch (i.e., no new commits in the target branch since the source branch was created), Git simply moves the pointer of the target branch to the latest commit of the source branch. Example: git checkout main git merge feature-branch If the target branch (e.g., main) hasn’t moved forward, the result is a fast-forward merge.","s":"Fast Forward Merge","u":"/docs/git/merge-and-rebase","h":"#fast-forward-merge","p":1126},{"i":1135,"t":"Rebasing is the process of moving or \"replaying\" commits from one branch onto another.

React was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook along with a community of developers. React focuses on creating interactive UIs by updating only the parts of the page that need to be changed, making the UI more efficient and responsive. React allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, reusable components. These components can manage their own state and render based on that state, ensuring that only the necessary components are re-rendered when data changes.","s":"Introduction","u":"/docs/frameworks-libraries/react/introduction","h":"","p":1254},{"i":1257,"t":"JSX (JavaScript XML): React uses JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript, that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX is later compiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel. This makes the code more readable and closely mirrors how the UI is structured. Example: const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>; Components: Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component can be a function or a class, and it returns a UI representation based on the input (props) and internal state. Functional Components: Simpler components that are just JavaScript functions. Class Components: Components that are more powerful and allow for state management and lifecycle methods. Example of a functional component: function Greeting(props) { return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>; } Props (Properties): Props are read-only values passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to communicate with each other and provide dynamic content. State: State refers to data that changes over time within a component. It is mutable and can trigger a re-render when updated. In functional components, you can manage state using the useState hook. Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0); Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM (VDOM) to improve performance. Instead of updating the entire DOM for every change, React updates a virtual representation of the DOM, compares it with the actual DOM, and then only applies the minimal changes required. This process is known as reconciliation. Lifecycle Methods (for Class Components): In class components, lifecycle methods allow developers to run code at different stages of a component's life, such as when it is being mounted, updated, or unmounted. Common lifecycle methods: componentDidMount() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount() Hooks (for Functional Components): Hooks are functions that allow you to \"hook into\" React features from functional components. Common hooks include: useState() useEffect() useContext() useReducer() Hooks provide a more concise and powerful way to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components. React Router: React Router is a library that enables navigation between different views or pages in a React application, helping build single-page applications (SPAs) with dynamic routing.","s":"Key Concepts in React","u":"/docs/frameworks-libraries/react/introduction","h":"#key-concepts-in-react","p":1254},{"i":1259,"t":"Component-Based Architecture: Encourages reusable, modular components, which makes the code more maintainable, readable, and testable. Declarative UI: React uses a declarative approach, where developers describe the UI state, and React ensures it is updated accordingly. This reduces the complexity of managing UI updates. Performance Optimization (Virtual DOM): The Virtual DOM optimizes rendering by minimizing direct updates to the actual DOM, improving the performance of applications, especially for larger projects. Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows from parent components to child components via props. This makes debugging easier as the data is predictable. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: React has a large and active community, with plenty of libraries, tools, and resources available to help developers. Cross-Platform Development: React Native, a framework based on React, allows developers to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using the same knowledge and codebase used for web development. SEO Friendly (with Server-Side Rendering): React can be rendered on the server side (using frameworks like Next.js), making it SEO-friendly. This helps in ensuring that search engines can crawl the content. Easy to Learn: React’s learning curve is relatively gentle for those who already have knowledge of JavaScript. Its component-based architecture also makes it easier to break down the learning process.","s":"Pros of React","u":"/docs/frameworks-libraries/react/introduction","h":"#pros-of-react","p":1254},{"i":1261,"t":"SEO Challenges (for Client-Side Rendering): Client-side rendering (CSR) may not be SEO-friendly out of the box. To address this, developers must implement server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) using frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby. Boilerplate Code: React applications can sometimes have a lot of boilerplate code, especially when setting up complex configurations like state management, routing, and hooks. Too Many Choices for State Management: React itself doesn’t provide an out-of-the-box solution for complex state management. As a result, developers often need to choose between tools like Redux, Context API, MobX, or Recoil, which can add complexity to the development process. Integration with Legacy Code: Integrating React with existing codebases can be challenging, especially when there’s a need to keep compatibility with older systems or libraries.","s":"Cons of React","u":"/docs/frameworks-libraries/react/introduction","h":"#cons-of-react","p":1254},{"i":1263,"t":"Single-Page Applications (SPAs): React’s component-based architecture and efficient rendering make it ideal for SPAs, where users interact with the application without needing to refresh the page. Dynamic Web Applications: React is well-suited for applications that require frequent UI updates based on changing data, such as dashboards, social media platforms, and news sites. Mobile Applications (React Native): With React Native, you can build cross-platform mobile applications for both iOS and Android, sharing much of the codebase between the web and mobile versions of an app. E-commerce Sites: React’s ability to handle large, dynamic datasets and re-render only changed parts of the UI makes it a good fit for e-commerce platforms where product catalogs, user reviews, and shopping carts need frequent updates. Content Management Systems (CMS): React can be used to build highly dynamic CMS where content changes often, and the UI needs to be updated in real-time without full page reloads. Interactive User Interfaces: React excels in scenarios where user interactions, such as animations, form validations, and dynamic updates, need to be handled efficiently. Real-Time Applications: React can be used to build chat applications, collaborative platforms, or any application where real-time data needs to be displayed or updated (e.g., live sports scoreboards).","s":"Use Cases of React","u":"/docs/frameworks-libraries/react/introduction","h":"#use-cases-of-react","p":1254},{"i":1265,"t":"Functions are fundamental building blocks in Go, allowing you to write reusable, modular, and maintainable code.

Simplicity: The language focuses on simplicity. Its minimalistic syntax allows developers to quickly write and maintain code. There are no complex inheritance hierarchies, and the code is easy to read and understand. Performance: Go is a compiled language, and it produces highly efficient machine code, making it a great choice for performance-critical applications, especially those that need to handle high concurrency and throughput. Strong Standard Library: Go’s standard library is powerful and versatile. It includes packages for web development, file handling, networking, cryptography, and more. This reduces the need for third-party libraries and frameworks. Cross-Platform: Go compiles to machine code, which means it can run on any platform. With Go, developers can easily compile their applications for different operating systems and architectures.

Limited GUI Support: Go is not as widely used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which means it lacks support for many UI-related libraries compared to other languages like Python or JavaScript. No Implicit Type Conversion: Go does not allow implicit type conversion (also known as coercion) between different types, which can be a bit restrictive for developers coming from more flexible languages like Python or JavaScript. Relatively Young Ecosystem: Although Go’s ecosystem is growing rapidly, there are still areas, especially in niche domains, where other languages like Python, Java, or C# might have a more mature ecosystem.","s":"Cons of Go","u":"/docs/programming-languages/go/introduction","h":"#cons-of-go","p":1356},{"i":1365,"t":"Many popular projects in the tech industry use Go because of its concurrency and performance advantages.

The goal is to make the language easy to learn, use, and maintain while providing powerful features like concurrency. Practicality Over Purity: Go prioritizes practical solutions over theoretical purity. For example, Go has a minimalist object-oriented approach (no classes or inheritance) but provides powerful composition via interfaces and structs. Speed and Efficiency: Go’s emphasis on performance is evident in its design decisions. It compiles quickly, has a low memory footprint, and provides easy-to-use concurrency models to handle large-scale systems. Fostering Readable Code: Go encourages developers to write clear, readable, and idiomatic code. The language’s toolchain (e.g., go fmt) enforces coding style conventions, ensuring consistency across projects. Minimalism and Modernization: Go seeks to modernize systems programming without introducing unnecessary complexity. The language’s simplicity and toolchain make it a good choice for building large-scale systems, microservices, and cloud applications.","s":"Philosophy of Go","u":"/docs/programming-languages/go/introduction","h":"#philosophy-of-go","p":1356},{"i":1369,"t":"Currently, I have notes on Python, JavaScript, and Go.

Local Cache Check: The computer checks its local cache for a stored DNS record for the domain. Recursive Resolver: If the record is not found, the request is forwarded to a recursive DNS resolver (usually provided by the ISP). Root Server Query: The recursive resolver queries one of the root DNS servers to find the TLD nameserver. TLD Server Query: The resolver queries the TLD nameserver (e.g., .com) to get the authoritative DNS server for the domain. Authoritative DNS Server: The authoritative DNS server for the domain provides the IP address (or other DNS records) for the domain. Final Response: The recursive resolver sends the resolved IP address back to the user's device, which can now connect to the website. This process ensures that domain names are efficiently translated into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites and services on the internet.","s":"How DNS Works","u":"/docs/system-design/networking/dns","h":"#how-dns-works","p":2941},{"i":2954,"t":"While DNS is an essential part of internet communication, it has some vulnerabilities. Here are some of the security challenges and solutions: DNS Spoofing (Cache Poisoning): Attackers can inject malicious DNS records into a resolver's cache, directing users to fraudulent websites. Solution: DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions): DNSSEC helps protect against spoofing by digitally signing DNS records and ensuring their integrity. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: DNS queries and responses are typically sent in plaintext, which can be intercepted and modified by attackers. Solution: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT): These protocols encrypt DNS traffic, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept or manipulate queries. DDoS Attacks: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can overwhelm DNS servers, rendering them unavailable. Solution: DNS servers implement various DDoS mitigation strategies, including rate limiting and redundancy. Phishing and Social Engineering: Attackers may manipulate DNS to direct users to phishing sites. Solution: Users can enable DNS filtering and browser security features, while DNS providers can implement anti-phishing measures.","s":"Security of DNS","u":"/docs/system-design/networking/dns","h":"#security-of-dns","p":2941},{"i":2956,"t":"DNS primarily uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for communication because: Speed: UDP is faster than TCP because it does not require the overhead of establishing a connection before data transmission. Low Latency: DNS queries are typically small and require quick responses. UDP allows DNS servers to reply faster without waiting for a connection setup. Stateless Communication: DNS queries are simple request-response interactions, where the stateless nature of UDP is sufficient. Since DNS does not need the reliability of TCP, using UDP improves performance. However, for large DNS responses (e.g., when DNSSEC is involved), DNS can fall back to TCP if the UDP packet size exceeds the maximum allowed size.","s":"Why DNS Uses UDP","u":"/docs/system-design/networking/dns","h":"#why-dns-uses-udp","p":2941},{"i":2958,"t":"Traditionally, DNS does not encrypt traffic for several reasons: Performance: Encrypting DNS queries would introduce additional overhead, slowing down the resolution process. Since DNS queries are typically short and frequent, encryption could have a noticeable impact on performance. Design Philosophy: The original design of DNS was built with the assumption that it would be used in trusted environments, and encryption was not considered necessary for most use cases. However, due to growing security concerns, modern DNS protocols like DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) have been introduced to encrypt DNS traffic, protecting it from interception and manipulation.","s":"Why DNS Does Not Use Encryption (Traditionally)","u":"/docs/system-design/networking/dns","h":"#why-dns-does-not-use-encryption-traditionally","p":2941},{"i":2960,"t":"Client-Server Architecture is a foundational model in network computing that structures applications into two main components: clients and servers.

ECDHE is a variant of DHE that uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) instead of modular arithmetic with large prime numbers. Why ECDHE? Smaller Keys: ECDHE offers the same security level as DHE but with much smaller key sizes, leading to better performance. Efficiency: Faster computations and reduced overhead, making it suitable for devices with limited resources. Steps in ECDHE: Both parties agree on an elliptic curve and a generator point G on that curve. Each party generates a private key (random scalar) and computes a public key by multiplying the private key with the generator point. Public keys are exchanged. Each party computes the shared secret by multiplying their private key with the other party's public key. This operation results in the same shared secret because of the commutative property of elliptic curve point multiplication.","s":"ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral)","u":"/docs/system-design/networking/tls","h":"#ecdhe-elliptic-curve-diffie-hellman-ephemeral","p":3171},{"i":3201,"t":"Feature DHE ECDHE Key Size Large (1024-4096 bits) Smaller (256-512 bits) Performance Slower Faster Security Strong Equally strong (or stronger) Use Case High-security environments Resource-constrained systems","s":"Comparison: DHE vs. ECDHE","u":"/docs/system-design/networking/tls","h":"#comparison-dhe-vs-ecdhe","p":3171},{"i":3204,"t":"The command chroot stands for \"change root\" and is a Unix/Linux system call and command used to change the apparent root directory of the current running process and its children to a new location in the filesystem.
