If any operation in the transaction fails (e.g., a UPDATE fails), the entire transaction will be rolled back, and no changes will be applied to the database. A rollback ensures the database is restored to its state before the transaction started. Example: Consider a transaction that involves transferring money from one account to another. If any step fails, both operations (debit and credit) should be rolled back. BEGIN; -- Debit from account 1 UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- If an error occurs, roll back the transaction -- Let's assume the credit operation fails, and We roll back UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- If something goes wrong, rollback the transaction ROLLBACK; In this example, if the UPDATE statement for the second account fails, the ROLLBACK command undoes both operations, ensuring that no money is debited or credited and the database stays in a consistent state.","s":"Atomicity","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#atomicity","p":201},{"i":206,"t":"Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another.

Example: Imagine a constraint that ensures an account balance cannot go negative. If a transaction attempts to withdraw more than the available balance, the transaction will violate this rule and be rolled back.

Different isolation levels control the visibility of intermediate transaction states to other transactions. PostgreSQL provides several isolation levels that determine how transactions interact with one another. The four isolation levels are: Read Uncommitted: Allows dirty reads. Transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions. Read Committed: A transaction sees only committed data at the time it is read. It prevents dirty reads but still allows non-repeatable reads. Repeatable Read: Ensures that once a transaction reads a value, it will see the same value throughout the transaction, preventing dirty and non-repeatable reads. Phantom reads are still possible. Serializable: The highest isolation level, which ensures that transactions execute as if they Oure serialized (one after the other). This level prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. We can set the isolation level for a transaction in PostgreSQL using the SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL command. Example of setting isolation levels in PostgreSQL: -- Start transaction with Read Committed isolation level (default) BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Repeatable Read isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; -- Our queries here COMMIT; -- Start transaction with Serializable isolation level BEGIN; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; -- Our queries here COMMIT; In each of these cases, PostgreSQL guarantees the level of isolation defined by the transaction's isolation level.

Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it cannot be undone (except by explicitly using a rollback mechanism in a new transaction). Example: If a transaction has been committed to transfer money from one account to another, the changes (debiting one account and crediting another) will persist even if the database system crashes right after the commit. BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Debit UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- Credit COMMIT; -- Once this commit happens, the changes are permanent -- A crash after this point won't undo the changes","s":"Durability","u":"/docs/databases/database-engineering/acid","h":"#durability","p":201},{"i":212,"t":"Atomicity: Ensures that all operations in a transaction are treated as a single unit.

If a transaction involves multiple operations, the database is either updated with all the changes, or none of them are applied. This guarantees the integrity of the data. Reliability: Transactions make sure that database operations are applied reliably, even in the event of system crashes. Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, ensuring that the database reflects the intended operations. Atomicity: The atomic nature of a transaction means that all operations within the transaction are treated as a single unit. If one operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring that partial updates do not corrupt the database. Concurrency: In multi-user environments, transactions help manage concurrent access to the database. They ensure that each transaction works as if it Oure the only transaction in the system, preventing conflicts and maintaining consistency. Error Handling: If an error occurs during a transaction, the changes can be rolled back, and the database can return to its previous consistent state.

Each table has a set of columns, which are called attributes. Each row in a table is called a tuple. The relational model was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. It is based on the mathematical concept of a relation, which is a set of ordered pairs. The relational model is used by most modern database management systems (DBMS). It is a very flexible model that can be used to represent a wide variety of data. The relational model is a way to represent data in a database. It uses tables to store data. Each table has rows and columns. Rows are called tuples. Columns are called attributes. The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. The relational model has the following components: Structure: The structure of a relational database is defined by a schema. A schema is a set of tables, columns, and constraints. Data: The data in a relational database is stored in tuples. Tuples are ordered sets of values. Integrity constraints: Integrity constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in a relational database. There are several types of integrity constraints, including primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and not null constraints. Operations: The operations that can be performed on a relational database include selection, projection, join, union, intersection, and difference. Primary Keys The primary key is a unique identifier for each tuple. It must be unique for each row in the table. It can be a single attribute or a combination of attributes. It is often used to join tables together. Foreign Keys The foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table. It allows you to create relationships between tables. It must match the data type of the primary key it references. It can be null if the relationship is optional. Constraints Constraints are rules that must be followed by the data in the table. They can be used to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include: NOT NULL: The attribute cannot be null. UNIQUE: The attribute must be unique for each row in the table. CHECK: The attribute must meet a certain condition.

Magnetic Tape: Access Time: Seconds to minutes Primarily used for archival storage; very slow access due to sequential reading. Why is Storage Hierarchy Important? Performance Optimization: Data is stored at the appropriate level based on its usage frequency. Frequently accessed data is kept in faster storage, while less frequently accessed data is stored in slower, cheaper storage. Cost Optimization: By using a hierarchy, organizations can balance performance and cost by storing data at the most suitable level.

Key Characteristics of Database Pages: Fixed Size: Pages have a predetermined size, typically measured in bytes. This ensures consistent data access and storage management. Header: The header section of a page contains metadata information, such as the page number, transaction ID, and flags indicating the page's status (e.g., dirty, free). Data Area: The data area stores the actual data, which can be organized in various ways depending on the database system and data structure. Free Space: Pages often include a free space area to accommodate insertions and updates without requiring the entire page to be rewritten. Oracle and some other databases can have different page sizes for each table. Page Management Techniques: Page Allocation: Determining which page to use for storing new data. This can be done using techniques like sequential allocation, linked allocation, or indexed allocation. Page Replacement: Deciding which page to remove from the buffer pool (in-memory cache) when a new page needs to be loaded. Common algorithms include LRU (Least Recently Used), FIFO (First-In-First-Out), and LFU (Least Frequently Used). Page Splitting and Merging: Handling situations where a page becomes full or nearly empty. Splitting a page creates two new pages, while merging combines two pages into one. Page Types: Data Pages: Store the actual data records. Index Pages: Store index entries that point to data pages, enabling efficient data retrieval. Metadata Pages: Store information about the database structure, such as table definitions, indexes, and constraints. Page-Based Storage Advantages: Efficiency: Pages provide a convenient size for reading and writing data to disk. Simplicity: They offer a uniform way to manage data storage. Performance: Page-based storage can improve performance by reducing the number of I/O operations required. Considerations: Page Size: The choice of page size can impact performance and storage efficiency. Larger pages may reduce the number of I/O operations but can also lead to wasted space if pages are not fully utilized. Also write operations can be slow if the page size is too large.

It's essentially a collection of free and used pages within a database file. The DBMS can locate a page on disk given a page id by using a linked list of pages or a page directory. Linked List: Header page holds pointers to a list of free pages and a list of data pages. However, if the DBMS is looking for a specific page, it has to do a sequential scan on the data page list until it finds the page it is looking for. Page Directory: DBMS maintains special pages, called page directory, to track locations of data pages, the amount of free space on each page, a list of free/empty pages and the page type. These special pages have one entry for each database object. Page Heap Algorithms: Different database systems use various algorithms to manage the page heap: First-Fit: The first free page that is large enough to accommodate the new data object is allocated. Best-Fit: The smallest free page that is large enough is allocated. Worst-Fit: The largest free page is allocated. The choice of algorithm can impact the performance and efficiency of the database system. For example, first-fit is often a good choice for simplicity and speed, but it can lead to fragmentation over time. Best-fit can reduce fragmentation but may require more overhead to find the best-fit page. Page Heap Fragmentation: Fragmentation occurs when free space is scattered across the page heap, resulting in small, non-contiguous free blocks. Fragmentation can reduce storage utilization and performance. To mitigate fragmentation, database systems may employ techniques like: Coalescing: Combining adjacent free pages into larger free blocks.

Key Components of a Slotted Page: Header: Number of Slots: The total number of slots in the page. Slot Directory: An array of slot descriptors, each containing the offset of the corresponding record and its length. Data Area: Stores the actual data records. Records can be of varying lengths and are stored contiguously. Advantages of Slotted Pages: Efficient Storage: Slotted pages allow for efficient storage of variable-length records. Flexible Record Insertion: New records can be inserted into free space within the page, reducing the need for page splits. Efficient Record Deletion: Deleted records can be marked as deleted without physically removing them from the page, allowing for potential reuse of the space. Disadvantages of Slotted Pages: Fragmentation: Over time, as records are inserted and deleted, fragmentation can occur, reducing storage utilization.

For example, MySQL's InnoDB storage engine uses RIDs to locate rows within clustered indexes. Usage: RIDs facilitate efficient data retrieval and support operations like updates and deletes by referencing specific tuples directly. NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB): Implementation: MongoDB utilizes ObjectIDs as unique identifiers for its documents. While not traditional RIDs, ObjectIDs serve a similar function by providing unique access points for documents. Usage: These IDs enable quick document retrieval and ensure that each document is uniquely identifiable across collections. Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis, Amazon DynamoDB): Implementation: In key-value databases, the key acts as a unique identifier for records. Although not RIDs in the classic sense, the keys function similarly by providing direct access to values. Usage: Keys allow for rapid data access without the need for additional indexing, making operations very efficient. Column-Family Stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra): Implementation: Cassandra uses a unique primary key for each row, which can be considered a form of RID. This key is crucial for directly accessing data within the distributed architecture. Usage: The primary key structure allows for efficient data retrieval and supports horizontal scalability, ensuring that data can be accessed quickly even in large datasets. Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j): Implementation: In Neo4j, every node and relationship has a unique internal identifier, functioning similarly to RIDs. These IDs allow for efficient traversal and querying of the graph structure.

Note that the DBMS does not need to store meta-data about the schema of the database here. Tuple Data: Actual data for attributes. Attributes are typically stored in the order that you specify them when you create the table. Most DBMSs do not allow a tuple to exceed the size of a page. Unique Identifier: Each tuple in the database is assigned a unique identifier. Most common: page id + (offset or slot). An application cannot rely on these ids to mean anything. Denormalized Tuple Data: If two tables are related, the DBMS can “pre-join” them, so the tables end up on the same page. This makes reads faster since the DBMS only has to load in one page rather than two separate pages.

Levels and Compaction: Data is stored in multiple levels, and when the memtable reaches a certain size, it’s flushed to disk as a new file (often called an SSTable). As these files accumulate, they are periodically merged and compacted to reduce redundancy, delete obsolete data, and keep read performance efficient.","s":"Concept and Structure","u":"/docs/databases/database-systems/lsm-tree","h":"#concept-and-structure","p":523},{"i":528,"t":"Memtable Insertion: Incoming writes (e.g., inserts, updates, deletes) are first placed into a memtable—an in-memory, sorted data structure. Writes are handled efficiently in memory, as they avoid random disk I/O. Write-Ahead Log (WAL): Before data is added to the memtable, it’s written to a write-ahead log (WAL). This ensures durability, as the WAL records each write operation sequentially on disk. If there’s a system crash, the WAL allows the database to recover any uncommitted data. Flushing the Memtable: When the memtable reaches a configured size, it’s flushed to disk as an immutable, sorted file called an SSTable (Sorted String Table). This flush process is a sequential write, which is faster and reduces wear on the disk. Compaction: Over time, multiple SSTables are created, potentially containing outdated or duplicate records. Compaction merges SSTables, removes deleted and old data, and organizes records for better read efficiency. This reduces the number of files on disk, balancing storage space with performance. Write Amplification: Frequent compactions increase write amplification, as data may be written to disk multiple times.

Since the memtable is in memory and sorted, it can be quickly searched for the requested key. Checking SSTables on Disk: If the key isn’t found in the memtable, the search continues in the SSTables on disk. SSTables are stored as a series of files on disk, typically organized by levels or tiers to manage access patterns. Bloom Filters: Each SSTable has an associated Bloom filter. This probabilistic data structure helps quickly determine whether a key might exist in a specific SSTable. The Bloom filter check minimizes unnecessary reads by eliminating SSTables that don’t contain the requested key. Searching SSTables: If the Bloom filter indicates that a key might exist in an SSTable, the database reads the relevant SSTable(s). Within each SSTable, data is sorted, allowing binary search, which is efficient for finding keys. Merging Results: In cases where the key exists in multiple SSTables (due to updates or deletes), the database merges the results, applying any updates or deletes as necessary. The latest version of the record is returned to the user. Read Amplification: Searching across multiple SSTables can lead to read amplification, meaning the system may need to access several files to retrieve a single record.

Unlike non-clustered indexes, where the data and index are separate, clustered indexes store the data directly in the leaf nodes of the B+ Tree. This close alignment between the index and the physical storage of data improves retrieval performance. Structure: The leaf nodes of the B+ Tree contain the actual data rows instead of pointers to the data. Ensures that the rows are physically sorted according to the index keys. Advantages: Improved Query Performance: Queries that require range scans or sequential access benefit from the physical ordering of data. Space Efficiency: Eliminates the need for an additional structure to store the data, as the index and data are integrated. Limitations: Single Clustered Index: A table can have only one clustered index due to the physical ordering constraint. Insertion Overhead: Maintaining the physical order can lead to page splits and additional write operations during inserts.

The pointers are then sorted by their physical page IDs to minimize random I/O operations. The sorted pointers are used to fetch the data, ensuring each page is accessed only once. Benefits: Reduced Disk I/O: Sorting page IDs minimizes the number of times the database needs to access the same page.

In-Memory Systems: Smaller nodes, such as 512 bytes or less, fit into CPU cache lines to minimize access latency. Workload considerations play a significant role; point queries favor smaller nodes, while sequential scans benefit from larger nodes. Merge Threshold: Eager Merging: Immediately merge nodes when they underflow. This approach ensures a tightly packed tree but can lead to frequent splits and merges under high update workloads. Lazy Merging: Postpone merging operations until a batch of updates is complete, reducing thrashing and improving overall performance. Some systems, like PostgreSQL, temporarily allow unbalanced trees to batch merge operations later. Variable Length Keys: Pointer-Based Storage: Instead of directly storing large keys, pointers to external storage reduce node size but introduce additional lookups. Fixed-Size Padding: Pads smaller keys to match the size of the largest key, simplifying node management at the cost of memory overhead. Key Map/Indirection: A mapping structure stores keys externally while retaining compact indices within nodes, commonly used in systems like PostgreSQL. Intra-Node Search: Linear Search: Simplest approach with O(n) complexity. Beneficial for small nodes or SIMD optimization. Binary Search: Efficient with O(log n) complexity, requiring sorted keys within nodes. Interpolation Search: Uses metadata (e.g., min/max key values) to estimate the target location.

Improves space efficiency for indexes with repeated values, such as boolean flags or category IDs. Suffix Truncation: Truncates keys in internal nodes to their minimal distinguishing prefix to save space. Example: Instead of storing \"dog\", \"dogma\", \"dogwood\" in internal nodes, only store \"d\", \"dogm\", and \"dogw\" for routing purposes. Pointer Swizzling: Converts page IDs into direct memory pointers during tree traversal to reduce buffer pool lookups. Improves performance for in-memory operations, particularly in read-heavy workloads. When a page is evicted, swizzled pointers revert back to their original IDs.

A Vector Index provides a way to efficiently query such data based on similarity, typically using distance metrics like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or Manhattan distance. A Vector Index maps vector representations (usually of high-dimensional data) to their corresponding entries in the database, allowing for fast retrieval of similar vectors based on a similarity measure. These indexes are widely used in search engines, recommender systems, image recognition systems, and natural language processing tasks, where items (e.g., documents, images, or products) are represented by vectors in a high-dimensional space.

Probabilistic Nature: Skip lists are probabilistic in nature because the level structure is determined by randomization.

React focuses on creating interactive UIs by updating only the parts of the page that need to be changed, making the UI more efficient and responsive. React allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, reusable components. These components can manage their own state and render based on that state, ensuring that only the necessary components are re-rendered when data changes.","s":"Introduction","u":"/docs/frameworks-libraries/react/introduction","h":"","p":1069},{"i":1072,"t":"JSX (JavaScript XML): React uses JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript, that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX is later compiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel. This makes the code more readable and closely mirrors how the UI is structured. Example: const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>; Components: Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component can be a function or a class, and it returns a UI representation based on the input (props) and internal state. Functional Components: Simpler components that are just JavaScript functions. Class Components: Components that are more powerful and allow for state management and lifecycle methods. Example of a functional component: function Greeting(props) { return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>; } Props (Properties): Props are read-only values passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to communicate with each other and provide dynamic content. State: State refers to data that changes over time within a component. It is mutable and can trigger a re-render when updated. In functional components, you can manage state using the useState hook. Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0); Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM (VDOM) to improve performance. Instead of updating the entire DOM for every change, React updates a virtual representation of the DOM, compares it with the actual DOM, and then only applies the minimal changes required. This process is known as reconciliation. Lifecycle Methods (for Class Components): In class components, lifecycle methods allow developers to run code at different stages of a component's life, such as when it is being mounted, updated, or unmounted. Common lifecycle methods: componentDidMount() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount() Hooks (for Functional Components): Hooks are functions that allow you to \"hook into\" React features from functional components. Common hooks include: useState() useEffect() useContext() useReducer() Hooks provide a more concise and powerful way to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

Declarative UI: React uses a declarative approach, where developers describe the UI state, and React ensures it is updated accordingly. This reduces the complexity of managing UI updates. Performance Optimization (Virtual DOM): The Virtual DOM optimizes rendering by minimizing direct updates to the actual DOM, improving the performance of applications, especially for larger projects. Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows from parent components to child components via props. This makes debugging easier as the data is predictable. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: React has a large and active community, with plenty of libraries, tools, and resources available to help developers. Cross-Platform Development: React Native, a framework based on React, allows developers to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using the same knowledge and codebase used for web development. SEO Friendly (with Server-Side Rendering): React can be rendered on the server side (using frameworks like Next.js), making it SEO-friendly.

Too Many Choices for State Management: React itself doesn’t provide an out-of-the-box solution for complex state management. As a result, developers often need to choose between tools like Redux, Context API, MobX, or Recoil, which can add complexity to the development process.

Mobile Applications (React Native): With React Native, you can build cross-platform mobile applications for both iOS and Android, sharing much of the codebase between the web and mobile versions of an app. E-commerce Sites: React’s ability to handle large, dynamic datasets and re-render only changed parts of the UI makes it a good fit for e-commerce platforms where product catalogs, user reviews, and shopping carts need frequent updates. Content Management Systems (CMS): React can be used to build highly dynamic CMS where content changes often, and the UI needs to be updated in real-time without full page reloads. Interactive User Interfaces: React excels in scenarios where user interactions, such as animations, form validations, and dynamic updates, need to be handled efficiently. Real-Time Applications: React can be used to build chat applications, collaborative platforms, or any application where real-time data needs to be displayed or updated (e.g., live sports scoreboards).","s":"Use Cases of React","u":"/docs/frameworks-libraries/react/introduction","h":"#use-cases-of-react","p":1069},{"i":1080,"t":"In web development, portals are a feature that allows developers to render a piece of React component or HTML content into a DOM node that exists outside the current hierarchy of the parent component.

Simplicity: The language focuses on simplicity. Its minimalistic syntax allows developers to quickly write and maintain code. There are no complex inheritance hierarchies, and the code is easy to read and understand. Performance: Go is a compiled language, and it produces highly efficient machine code, making it a great choice for performance-critical applications, especially those that need to handle high concurrency and throughput. Strong Standard Library: Go’s standard library is powerful and versatile. It includes packages for web development, file handling, networking, cryptography, and more. This reduces the need for third-party libraries and frameworks. Cross-Platform: Go compiles to machine code, which means it can run on any platform. With Go, developers can easily compile their applications for different operating systems and architectures.

Scalable Concurrency: Go’s concurrency model with goroutines and channels makes it easy to scale applications to handle a large number of tasks simultaneously without much complexity. Built-in Garbage Collection: Go has a powerful garbage collector that automatically manages memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks. Rich Ecosystem and Libraries: Go has a well-established ecosystem, including web frameworks (e.g., Gin, Echo), microservices tools (e.g., Go-Kit, Go-Micro), and cloud-native tools (e.g., Kubernetes).

Common caching strategies include: Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading): Description: Data is loaded into the cache only when it is requested. How it Works: Application checks the cache for data. If data is missing, it fetches the data from the source and updates the cache. Advantages: Simple to implement. Ensures only frequently accessed data is cached. Disadvantages: First access is always slower (cache miss). Use Case: Database query result caching. Write-Through: Description: Data is written to the cache and the source database simultaneously. How it Works: Every write operation updates both the cache and the database. Advantages: Ensures cache consistency with the database. Disadvantages: Slower write operations due to dual writes. Use Case: Scenarios requiring strong consistency. Write-Back (Lazy Write): Description: Data is written to the cache, and the database is updated asynchronously. How it Works: Cache updates are prioritized, and the database is updated later in batches. Advantages: Faster write operations. Disadvantages: Risk of data loss if the cache fails before syncing with the database. Use Case: High-throughput applications where write speed is critical. Read-Through: Description: Application interacts with the cache, which fetches data from the source if necessary. How it Works: Cache acts as an intermediary for read operations. Advantages: Simplifies application logic. Ensures data is always up-to-date in the cache. Disadvantages: Adds complexity to the caching layer. Use Case: Content delivery networks (CDNs). Refresh-Ahead: Description: Proactively refreshes cache entries before they expire. How it Works: Cache monitors access patterns and pre-fetches data likely to be accessed soon.

Use Case: Web applications with frequently accessed user sessions or profiles. Least Frequently Used (LFU): Mechanism: Tracks the number of times each cache entry is accessed and removes the least frequently accessed entry. Advantages: Prioritizes frequently accessed data.

Advantages: Extremely simple and has minimal computational overhead. Disadvantages: May remove important data unpredictably. Use Case: Situations where cache misses are inexpensive. Time-Based Expiry: Mechanism: Removes data from the cache after a predefined time-to-live (TTL) period. Advantages: Ensures cache remains fresh without complex tracking mechanisms.

If there are no conflicts, it combines the changes into a new merge commit. Merge Commit: A new commit is created to record the merge operation.

The commit hash is generated based on the commit content, including the author, timestamp, commit message, and the tree object that represents the file snapshot. Files: Files are stored as blobs in Git. A blob object is assigned a SHA-1 hash based on the content of the file. Directories: Git represents directories as tree objects. A tree object groups blobs (files) and other tree objects (subdirectories) under a particular directory structure. Tags: Git uses SHA-1 to uniquely identify tags that point to specific commits.

These values can be reused for multiple sessions. Private Key Generation: Each party generates a private key: Party A chooses a private key a (a large random number). Party B chooses a private key b (another large random number). Compute Public Keys: Both parties calculate their public keys using the formula: Party A computes A = g^a mod p and sends A to Party B. Party B computes B = g^b mod p and sends B to Party A. Shared Secret Derivation: Each party uses the other’s public key and their private key to compute the shared secret: Party A computes S = B^a mod p. Party B computes S = A^b mod p. Both computations yield the same result because (g^b)^a mod p = (g^a)^b mod p.

Efficiency: Faster computations and reduced overhead, making it suitable for devices with limited resources. Steps in ECDHE: Both parties agree on an elliptic curve and a generator point G on that curve. Each party generates a private key (random scalar) and computes a public key by multiplying the private key with the generator point. Public keys are exchanged.
