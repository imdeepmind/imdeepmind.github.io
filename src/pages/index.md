## Software Engineering

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience. I specialize in full-stack development, working with both frontend and backend technologies. My skill set includes programming languages like Python, GoLang and JavaScript, and a variety of frameworks/libraries for both front-end and backend.

I'm also skilled in cloud platforms like AWS (AWS Certified) and Azure, which I use to build and deploy scalable applications. My work often involves developing RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and I have a strong grasp of databases, both SQL and NoSQL.

Beyond my professional work, I'm the founder of Rocket a platform for rapidly building backend APIs, and Delphy, a web app for analyzing open-source packages. I've also contributed to the open-source community by creating packages such as Hocrox, PCY, and NeuralPy.

Currently, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at TechVariable. Prior to this role, I worked at a startup called Flexday.
