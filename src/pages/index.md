## Hey there

I'm Abhishek Chatterjee a **Senior Software Engineer I at SurveyMonkey** with **more than 6 years** of experience working as a Software Engineer. My skill set includes programming languages like **Python**, **Go** and **JavaScript**, and a variety of frameworks/libraries for both front-end and backend.

I'm also skilled in cloud platforms like **AWS** ([AWS Certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/e870c199-cd61-4a2d-8003-fa2c9fe5e47f/linked_in_profile)) and Azure, which I use to build and deploy scalable applications. My work often involves building backend systems, and I have a strong grasp on databases, both SQL and NoSQL.

Beyond my professional work, I'm the founder of [Rocket](https://rocketapi.net) a platform for rapidly building backend APIs, and Delphy, a web app for analyzing open-source packages. I've also contributed to the open-source community by creating packages such as [Hocrox](https://github.com/imdeepmind/hocrox), [PCY](https://github.com/imdeepmind/python-completes-you), and [NeuralPy](https://github.com/imdeepmind/NeuralPy).

On this site, I publish my study notes and write blogs, primarily focused on software engineering and programming. You can read the [Introduction](https://imdeepmind.com/blog/imdeepmind-introduction) post to get a clearer idea of what this website is about.

## Traveling, driving, biking, and hiking

I’ve always loved traveling. Most of my trips are on my bike or in my car, depending on my destination and how much time I have. There’s something about long rides and open roads that clears my mind and makes the journey enjoyable.

Recently, I’ve started hiking, and it’s becoming one of my favorite ways to explore new places. It’s slower and quieter, and it encourages you to soak in the surroundings instead of just passing through. It’s a different kind of travel, but I enjoy it just as much.

## Photography

I travel a lot, and over time, taking photos became part of how I experience new places. Most of what I capture is landscapes, scenes that made me stop or views that felt worth remembering. Nothing fancy, just shots that show what I saw and how it felt to be there. If you want to check them out, all my photos are available at my [gallery](https://gallery.imdeepmind.com/).

Here are a few of my images that I've taken:
